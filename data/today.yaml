  - title: "Q&A: Developing a sustainable power grid in the era of AI"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-qa-sustainable-power-grid-era.html
    summary: Le Xie, Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Harvard John A.
      Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), wants to know
      how we can modernize the electric grid to support rapid electrification
      and the growing demands of AI infrastructure. His research at SEAS focuses
      on the intersection of power systems, artificial intelligence, and
      decarbonization. We spoke to him about his work and the challenges facing
      the electric grid today. This interview has been edited for clarity and
      length.

    summary: "What is patient privacy for? The Hippocratic Oath, thought to be one
      of the earliest and most widely known medical ethics texts in the world,
      reads: “Whatever I see or hear in the lives of my patients, whether in
      connection with my professional practice or not, which ought not to be
      spoken of outside, I will keep secret, as considering all such things to
      be private.”"

  - title: Online 'brainrot' isn't ruining children's minds; it's a new way of
      navigating the modern internet
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-online-brainrot-isnt-children-minds.html
    summary: '"Brainrot" is what many people call the chaotic, fast-moving memes,
      sounds and catchphrases that spread across TikTok, Roblox and online
      gaming and into playgrounds. An example is the endlessly repeated chant of
      "six-seven," which still echoes through houses and schools across the
      country—to the bewilderment (or annoyance) of many teachers and parents.'

      batteries
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ultrathin-polymer-layer-lifespan-anode.html
    summary: Anode-free lithium metal batteries, which have attracted attention as
      candidates for electric vehicles, drones, and next-generation
      high-performance batteries, offer much higher energy density than
      conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, their short lifespan has made
      commercialization difficult.

    summary: If a data center is moving in next door, you probably live in the
      United States. More than half of all upcoming global data centers—as
      indicated by land purchased for data centers not yet announced, those
      under construction, and those whose plans are public—will be developed in
      the United States.

  - title: Physicists found hidden order in violent proton collisions
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260104202125.htm
    summary: Inside high-energy proton collisions, quarks and gluons briefly form a
      dense, boiling state before cooling into ordinary particles. Researchers
      expected this transition to change how disordered the system is, but LHC
      data tell a different story. A newly improved collision model matches
      experiments better than older ones and reveals that the “entropy” remains
      unchanged throughout the process. This unexpected result turns out to be a
      direct fingerprint of quantum mechanics at work.

  - title: AI may not need massive training data after all
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251228074457.htm
    summary: New research shows that AI doesn’t need endless training data to start
      acting more like a human brain. When researchers redesigned AI systems to
      better resemble biological brains, some models produced brain-like
      activity without any training at all. This challenges today’s data-hungry
      approach to AI development. The work suggests smarter design could
      dramatically speed up learning while slashing costs and energy use.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

  - title: From individuals to crews, AI brings teamwork into construction
      productivity analysis
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-individuals-crews-ai-teamwork-productivity.html
    summary: Researchers at National Taiwan University have developed an AI system
      that recognizes construction activities at both the individual and crew
      levels using ordinary site videos. The approach reveals how teamwork
      shapes productivity and provides a foundation for future human–robot
      collaboration on construction sites.

  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
