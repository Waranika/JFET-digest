  - title: China ramps up energy boom flagged by Musk as key to AI race
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-china-ramps-energy-boom-flagged.html
    summary: New data on China's relentless energy installations underscore warnings
      from Elon Musk and Jensen Huang that the nation's world-beating power
      network will deliver a major advantage over the U.S. in the race to
      dominate artificial intelligence.

  - title: Is artificial general intelligence already here? A new case that today's
      LLMs meet key tests
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-artificial-general-intelligence-case-today.html
    summary: Will artificial intelligence ever be able to reason, learn, and solve
      problems at levels comparable to humans? Experts at the University of
      California San Diego believe the answer is yes—and that such artificial
      general intelligence has already arrived. This debate is tackled by four
      faculty members spanning humanities, social sciences, and data science in
      a recently published Comment invited by Nature.

  - title: City skylines need an upgrade in the face of climate stress
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-city-skylines-climate-stress.html
    summary: When structural engineers design a building, they aren't just stacking
      floors; they are calculating how to win a complex battle against nature.
      Every building is built to withstand a specific "budget" of environmental
      stress—the weight of record snowfalls, the push of powerful winds, and the
      expansion caused by summer heat.

    summary: Ever feel run off your feet? Spare a thought for sea stars, creatures
      whose movement involves the coordination of hundreds of tiny tube feet to
      navigate complex environments—despite the lack of a central "brain."

  - title: Low-Vision Programmers Can Now Design 3D Models Independently
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-modeling-blind-programmers
    summary: Most 3D design software requires visual dragging and rotating—posing a
      challenge for blind and low-vision users. As a result, a range of hardware
      design, robotics, coding, and engineering work is inaccessible to
      interested programmers. A visually-impaired programmer might write great
      code. But because of the lack of accessible modeling software, the coder
      can’t model, design, and verify physical and virtual components of their
      system.

      replays and Olympics GPT, get ready to immerse yourself in the Winter
      Games in Milan and Cortina.

  - title: “This is science!” – MIT president talks about the importance of
      America’s research enterprise on GBH’s Boston Public Radio
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/science-mit-president-talks-about-importance-americas-research-enterprise-gbhs-boston-public
    summary: In a wide-ranging live conversation, MIT President Sally Kornbluth
      joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan live in studio for GBH’s Boston Public
      Radio on Thursday, February 5. They talked about MIT, the pressures facing
      America’s research enterprise, the importance of science, that
      Congressional hearing on antisemitism in 2023, and more – including
      Sally’s experience as a Type 1 diabetic.

  - title: Scientists create smart synthetic skin that can hide images and change
      shape
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206034836.htm
    summary: Inspired by the shape-shifting skin of octopuses, Penn State
      researchers developed a smart hydrogel that can change appearance,
      texture, and shape on command. The material is programmed using a special
      printing technique that embeds digital instructions directly into the
      skin. Images and information can remain invisible until triggered by heat,
      liquids, or stretching.

  - title: A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm
    summary: Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to
      disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to
      perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than
      pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice
      surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing
      control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up
      into something truly powerful.

  - title: This tiny molecular trick makes spider silk almost unbreakable
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012210.htm
    summary: Scientists have cracked a key mystery behind spider silk’s legendary
      strength and flexibility. They discovered that tiny molecular interactions
      act like natural glue, holding silk proteins together as they transform
      from liquid into incredibly tough fibers. This same process helps create
      silk that’s stronger than steel by weight and tougher than Kevlar.

      that artificial intelligence could crack one of biology’s deepest
      mysteries: how a string of amino acids folds itself into a working
      molecular machine."

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."

      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent
      spinninginside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.Most of all: ones
      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
