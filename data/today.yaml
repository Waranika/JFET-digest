  - title: "'Periodic table' for AI methods aims to drive innovation"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-periodic-table-ai-methods-aims.html
    summary: Artificial intelligence is increasingly used to integrate and analyze
      multiple types of data formats, such as text, images, audio and video. One
      challenge slowing advances in multimodal AI, however, is the process of
      choosing the algorithmic method best aligned to the specific task an AI
      system needs to perform.

  - title: How the RESISTORS Put Computing into 1960s Counter-culture
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/teenage-hackers
    summary: In late April of 1968, a computer conference in Atlantic City, N.J.,
      got off to a rocky start. A strike by telephone operators prevented
      exhibitors from linking their terminals to off-site computers, as
      union-sympathetic workers refused to wire up the necessary connections.
      Companies’ displays were effectively dead.

  - title: People Are Already Taking This Unapproved New Weight-Loss Drug
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-already-taking-this-unapproved-new-weight-loss-drug-triple-g-retatrutide/
    summary: Retatrutide, originally developed by Eli Lilly, has found a loyal fan
      base—even though clinical trials of the drug still haven’t finished.

    summary: Let’s say an environmental scientist is studying whether exposure to
      air pollution is associated with lower birth weights in a particular
      county.

  - title: Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm
    summary: Scientists have uncovered that some atoms in liquids don't move at
      all—even at extreme temperatures—and these anchored atoms dramatically
      alter the way materials freeze. Using advanced electron microscopy,
      researchers watched molten metal droplets solidify and found that
      stationary atoms can trap liquids in tiny “atomic corrals,” keeping them
      fluid far below their normal freezing point and giving rise to a strange
      hybrid state of matter.

    summary: Prevent costly AI failures in production by mastering data-centric
      approaches to detect bias, classimbalance, and data leakage before
      deployment impacts your business.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-vine-robotic-gripper-gently-heavy.html
    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
