  - title: "From brain scans to alloys: Teaching AI to make sense of complex
      research data"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-brain-scans-alloys-ai-complex.html
    summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to analyze medical
      images, materials data and scientific measurements, but many systems
      struggle when real-world data do not match ideal conditions. Measurements
      collected from different instruments, experiments or simulations often
      vary widely in resolution, noise and reliability. Traditional
      machine-learning models typically assume those differences are
      negligible—an assumption that can limit accuracy and trustworthiness.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-method-sharpens-3d-ray.html
    summary: X-ray tomography is a powerful tool that enables scientists and
      engineers to peer inside of objects in 3D, including computer chips and
      advanced battery materials, without performing anything invasive. It's the
      same basic method behind medical CT scans.

  - title: A new crystal makes magnetism twist in surprising ways
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112001039.htm
    summary: Florida State University scientists have engineered a new crystal that
      forces atomic magnets to swirl into complex, repeating patterns. The
      effect comes from mixing two nearly identical compounds whose mismatched
      structures create magnetic tension at the atomic level. These swirling
      “skyrmion-like” textures are prized for their low-energy behavior and
      stability. The discovery could help drive advances in data storage,
      energy-efficient electronics, and quantum computing.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a ten-fold reduction in
      inference costs and a four-fold reduction in how many GPUs it would take
      to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: Stanford’s AI spots hidden disease warnings that show up while you sleep
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260109023114.htm
    summary: Stanford researchers have developed an AI that can predict future
      disease risk using data from just one night of sleep. The system analyzes
      detailed physiological signals, looking for hidden patterns across the
      brain, heart, and breathing. It successfully forecast risks for conditions
      like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. The results suggest sleep
      contains early health warnings doctors have largely overlooked.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/3-questions-how-ai-could-optimize-power-grid-0109
    summary: Artificial intelligence has captured headlines recently for its rapidly
      growing energy demands, and particularly the surging electricity usage of
      data centers that enable the training and deployment of the latest
      generative AI models. But it’s not all bad news — some AI tools have the
      potential to reduce some forms of energy consumption and enable cleaner
      grids.

  - title: 2.009 mechanical engineering students embrace “cycles”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
