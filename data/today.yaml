  - title: "Creative talent: Has AI knocked humans out?"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-creative-talent-ai-humans.html
    summary: Are generative artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT truly
      creative? A research team led by Professor Karim Jerbi from the Department
      of Psychology at the Université de Montréal, and including AI pioneer
      Yoshua Bengio, also a professor at Université de Montréal, has just
      published the largest comparative study ever conducted on the creativity
      of large language models versus humans.

      mineral from low-grade brines"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-vast-lithium-faster-cleaner-method.html
    summary: "Demand for lithium is skyrocketing as factories across the world churn
      out electric vehicles and the massive batteries that make wind turbines
      and solar panels reliable sources of energy. Unfortunately, current
      methods for producing lithium are slow and require high-quality feedstocks
      that are found in relatively few locations on the planet. Ironically, the
      environmental costs are also significant: refining the mineral behind
      clean energy requires large amounts of land and pollutes water supplies
      that local communities depend on."

      freezing rain this weekend. Exactly where, what, and how much remains
      uncertain.

    summary: "Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and
      says: “I’ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous
      instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand
      over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what large language models
      (LLMs) do."

  - title: Handy robot can crawl and pick up objects from multiple angles
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-handy-robot-multiple-angles.html
    summary: Like something out of the Addams Family, scientists have created a
      detachable robotic hand that can crawl and grab objects. The design
      enables tasks such as retrieving objects beyond normal reach and
      performing multi-object handling, offering potential applications in
      industrial, service, and exploratory robotics.

  - title: This new building material pulls carbon out of the air
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260121034148.htm
    summary: A new building material developed by engineers at Worcester Polytechnic
      Institute could change how the world builds. Made using an enzyme that
      turns carbon dioxide into solid minerals, the material cures in hours and
      locks away carbon instead of releasing it. It’s strong, repairable,
      recyclable, and far cleaner than concrete. If adopted widely, it could
      slash emissions across the construction industry.

  - title: The human brain may work more like AI than anyone expected
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000308.htm
    summary: Scientists have discovered that the human brain understands spoken
      language in a way that closely resembles how advanced AI language models
      work. By tracking brain activity as people listened to a long podcast,
      researchers found that meaning unfolds step by step—much like the layered
      processing inside systems such as GPT-style models.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/atmoszero-electrifies-boilers-to-decarbonize-industry-0121
    summary: More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial
      Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial
      activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by
      burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant
      percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of
      paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

  - title: Unbreakable? Researchers warn quantum computers have serious security flaws
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000330.htm
    summary: Quantum computers could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to
      business analytics—but their incredible power also makes them surprisingly
      vulnerable. New research from Penn State warns that today’s quantum
      machines are not just futuristic tools, but potential gold mines for
      hackers. The study reveals that weaknesses can exist not only in software,
      but deep within the physical hardware itself, where valuable algorithms
      and sensitive data may be exposed.

  - title: Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
