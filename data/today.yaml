  - title: Researchers unlock hidden dimensions inside a single photon
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260226042500.htm
    summary: Researchers have discovered new ways to shape quantum light, creating
      high-dimensional states that can carry much more information per photon.
      Using advanced tools like on-chip photonics and ultrafast light
      structuring, they’re pushing quantum communication and imaging into
      exciting new territory. Although long-distance transmission remains
      tricky, innovative approaches—such as topological quantum states—could
      make these fragile signals far more resilient. The momentum suggests
      quantum optics is entering a bold new phase.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-math-benchmarks
    summary: Mathematics is often regarded as the ideal domain for measuring AI
      progress effectively. Math’s step-by-step logic is easy to track, and its
      definitive automatically verifiable answers remove any human or subjective
      factors. But AI systems are improving at such a pace that math benchmarks
      are struggling to keep up.

  - title: Jimi Hendrix Was a Systems Engineer
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/jimi-hendrix-systems-engineer
    summary: 3 February 1967 is a day that belongs in the annals of music history.
      It’s the day that Jimi Hendrix entered London’s Olympic Studios to record
      a song using a new component. The song was “Purple Haze,” and the
      component was the Octavia guitar pedal, created for Hendrix by sound
      engineer Roger Mayer. The pedal was a key element of a complex chain of
      analog elements responsible for the final sound, including the acoustics
      of the studio room itself. When they sent the tapes for remastering in the
      United States, the sounds on it were so novel that they included an
      accompanying note explaining that the distortion at the end was not
      malfunction but intention. A few months later, Hendrix would deliver his
      legendary electric guitar performance at the Monterey International Pop
      Festival.

  - title: Generative AI analyzes medical data faster than human research teams
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260221060942.htm
    summary: Researchers tested whether generative AI could handle complex medical
      datasets as well as human experts. In some cases, the AI matched or
      outperformed teams that had spent months building prediction models. By
      generating usable analytical code from precise prompts, the systems
      dramatically reduced the time needed to process health data. The findings
      hint at a future where AI helps scientists move faster from data to
      discovery.

  - title: Quantum computer breakthrough tracks qubit fluctuations in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219040756.htm
    summary: Qubits, the heart of quantum computers, can change performance in
      fractions of a second — but until now, scientists couldn’t see it
      happening. Researchers at NBI have built a real-time monitoring system
      that tracks these rapid fluctuations about 100 times faster than previous
      methods. Using fast FPGA-based control hardware, they can instantly
      identify when a qubit shifts from “good” to “bad.” The discovery opens a
      new path toward stabilizing and scaling future quantum processors.

    summary: A new artificial intelligence control system enables soft robotic arms
      to learn a wide repertoire of motions and tasks once, then adjust to new
      scenarios on the fly, without needing retraining or sacrificing
      functionality.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.
