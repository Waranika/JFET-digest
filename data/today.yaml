  - title: How smart home materials can shield us from extreme heat and cut energy
      bills all year
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-smart-home-materials-shield-extreme.html
    summary: Australia is getting hotter. Climate change is driving more frequent
      and prolonged extreme heat waves and our homes are struggling to keep up.
      Alarmingly, many Australian houses—especially older ones—weren't designed
      for these harsh conditions.

  - title: AI is quick but risky for updating old software, researchers warn
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-quick-risky-software.html
    summary: At first glance, artificial intelligence looks like a software
      developer's dream. A recent McKinsey & Company report found that
      programmers generated code up to 45% faster with the help of generative
      AI.

    summary: Paid tools that “strip” clothes from photos have been available on the
      darker corners of the internet for years. Elon Musk’s X is now removing
      barriers to entry—and making the results public.

  - title: Ancient board game tactics help AI unlock optimal cooling strategies
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ancient-board-game-tactics-ai.html
    summary: "It's a simple law of physics: When electricity or fuel powers a
      machine, the machine gets hotter. Finding new ways to cool machines
      quickly and controllably can mean the difference between a functioning
      electrical grid and a blackout or a working data center and a widespread
      outage."

  - title: Scientists create robots smaller than a grain of salt that can think
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260105165815.htm
    summary: Researchers have created microscopic robots so small they’re barely
      visible, yet smart enough to sense, decide, and move completely on their
      own. Powered by light and equipped with tiny computers, the robots swim by
      manipulating electric fields rather than using moving parts. They can
      detect temperature changes, follow programmed paths, and even work
      together in groups. The breakthrough marks the first truly autonomous
      robots at this microscopic scale.

  - title: Hyundai and Boston Dynamics unveil humanoid robot Atlas at CES
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-hyundai-boston-dynamics-unveil-humanoid.html
    summary: Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics publicly demonstrated its humanoid robot
      Atlas for the first time Monday at the CES tech showcase, ratcheting up a
      competition with Tesla and other rivals to build robots that look like
      people and do things that people do.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/mit-scientists-investigate-memorization-risk-clinical-ai-0105
    summary: "What is patient privacy for? The Hippocratic Oath, thought to be one
      of the earliest and most widely known medical ethics texts in the world,
      reads: “Whatever I see or hear in the lives of my patients, whether in
      connection with my professional practice or not, which ought not to be
      spoken of outside, I will keep secret, as considering all such things to
      be private.”"

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-growth
    summary: If a data center is moving in next door, you probably live in the
      United States. More than half of all upcoming global data centers—as
      indicated by land purchased for data centers not yet announced, those
      under construction, and those whose plans are public—will be developed in
      the United States.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
