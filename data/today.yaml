  - title: Will Google be 'third time lucky' with new, AI-powered smart glasses?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-google-lucky-ai-powered-smart.html
    summary: It has been over a decade since Google Glass smart glasses were
      announced in 2013, followed by their swift withdrawal—in part because of
      low adoption. Their subsequent (and lesser known) second iteration was
      released in 2017 and aimed at the workplace. They were withdrawn in 2023.

  - title: Solid-state material can store and release hydrogen using sunlight or LEDs
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-solid-state-material-hydrogen-sunlight.html
    summary: Hydrogen, a clean energy source, requires a highly reliable and safe
      storage system, which is currently lacking. Layered hydrogen silicane
      (L-HSi) is a promising, safe, lightweight, and energy-efficient
      solid-state hydrogen carrier with potential for practical utility. This
      material releases hydrogen when irradiated with low-intensity
      visible-light sources like sunlight or LEDs. L-HSi represents a new
      direction for hydrogen carrier system research.

  - title: Inside the mysterious collapse of dark matter halos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233609.htm
    summary: Physicists have unveiled a new way to simulate a mysterious form of
      dark matter that can collide with itself but not with normal matter. This
      self-interacting dark matter may trigger a dramatic collapse inside dark
      matter halos, heating and densifying their cores in surprising ways. Until
      now, this crucial middle ground of behavior was nearly impossible to model
      accurately. The new code makes these simulations faster, more precise, and
      accessible enough to run on a laptop.

  - title: This tiny power module could change how the world uses energy
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233604.htm
    summary: As global energy demand surges—driven by AI-hungry data centers,
      advanced manufacturing, and electrified transportation—researchers at the
      National Renewable Energy Laboratory have unveiled a breakthrough that
      could help squeeze far more power from existing electricity supplies.
      Their new silicon-carbide-based power module, called ULIS, packs
      dramatically more power into a smaller, lighter, and cheaper design while
      wasting far less energy in the process.

  - title: Soft robotic hand 'sees' around corners to achieve human-like touch
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-soft-robotic-corners-human.html
    summary: To reliably complete household chores, assemble products and tackle
      other manual tasks, robots should be able to adapt their manipulation
      strategies based on the objects they are working with, similarly to how
      humans leverage information they gain via the sense of touch. While humans
      attain tactile information via nerves in their skin and muscles, robots
      rely on sensors, devices that sense their surroundings and pick up
      specific physical signals.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260117053526.htm
    summary: Researchers have turned artificial intelligence into a powerful new
      lens for understanding why cancer survival rates differ so dramatically
      around the world. By analyzing cancer data and health system information
      from 185 countries, the AI model highlights which factors, such as access
      to radiotherapy, universal health coverage, and economic strength, are
      most closely linked to better survival in each nation.

  - title: The breakthrough that makes robot faces feel less creepy
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035308.htm
    summary: Humans pay enormous attention to lips during conversation, and robots
      have struggled badly to keep up. A new robot developed at Columbia
      Engineering learned realistic lip movements by watching its own reflection
      and studying human videos online. This allowed it to speak and sing with
      synchronized facial motion, without being explicitly programmed.
      Researchers believe this breakthrough could help robots finally cross the
      uncanny valley.

    summary: The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in
      the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from
      across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence
      through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These
      researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering,
      the humanities, and more.

    summary: 'If you use consumer AI systems, you have likely experienced something
      like AI "brain fog": You are well into a conversation when suddenly the AI
      seems to lose track of the different ideas you have been talking about and
      how they fit together.'

    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
