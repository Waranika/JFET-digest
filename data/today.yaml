  - title: A new way to make steel could reduce America’s reliance on imports
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/new-way-make-steel-could-reduce-americas-reliance-imports-0213
    summary: America has been making steel from iron ore the same way for hundreds
      of years. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been making enough of it. Today the
      U.S. is the world’s largest steel importer, relying on other countries to
      produce a material that serves as the backbone of our society.

  - title: "Turning down the heat: Researcher identifies better way to remove heat
      from AI data centers"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-centers.html
    summary: A University of Houston professor has taken on the global challenge of
      reducing the staggering amount of heat generated in artificial
      intelligence data centers. Hadi Ghasemi, J. Willard Gibbs Distinguished
      Professor of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, has found that thin films
      designed into tree-like, or branched shapes release heat at least three
      times better than today's best methods.

  - title: The insect-inspired bionic eye that sees, smells and guides robots
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-insect-bionic-eye-robots.html
    summary: The compound eyes of the humble fruit fly are a marvel of nature. They
      are wide-angle and can process visual information several times faster
      than the human eye. Inspired by this biological masterpiece, researchers
      at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an insect-scale compound
      eye that can both see and smell, potentially improving how drones and
      robots navigate complex environments and avoid obstacles.

  - title: Rethinking rush hour with vehicle automation
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-rethinking-hour-vehicle-automation.html
    summary: It's often the worst part of many people's day—bottlenecked, rush-hour
      traffic. When the daily commute backs up, drivers lose time, burn fuel and
      waste energy. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's National
      Transportation Research Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are
      tackling this problem with cooperative driving automation (CDA), an
      emerging technology that allows vehicles and traffic infrastructure to
      communicate, keeping traffic flowing efficiently and safely.

    summary: As the EPA moves to roll back the endangerment finding, which allows it
      to regulate greenhouse gases, experts predict uncertainty for business and
      a protracted legal fight.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: Startups Are Betting on Orbital Growth for Advanced Electronics
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-orbit-manufacturing
    summary: This past December, the U.K. start-up Space Forge turned on an orbital
      furnace aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite, producing a stream of super-hot
      plasma that could someday enable production of near-ideal semiconductor
      crystals in orbit. Hailed as a breakthrough in orbital manufacturing, the
      milestone is a first for a free-flying commercial satellite and a payload
      not operated by humans.

  - title: AI reads brain MRIs in seconds and flags emergencies
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210005419.htm
    summary: Researchers at the University of Michigan have created an AI system
      that can interpret brain MRI scans in just seconds, accurately identifying
      a wide range of neurological conditions and determining which cases need
      urgent care. Trained on hundreds of thousands of real-world scans along
      with patient histories, the model achieved accuracy as high as 97.5% and
      outperformed other advanced AI tools.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm
    summary: Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to
      disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to
      perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than
      pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice
      surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing
      control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up
      into something truly powerful.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
