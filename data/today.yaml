  - title: "Helping AI agents search to get the best results out of large language
      models "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/helping-ai-agents-search-to-get-best-results-from-llms-0205
    summary: Whether you’re a scientist brainstorming research ideas or a CEO hoping
      to automate a task in human resources or finance, you’ll find that
      artificial intelligence tools are becoming the assistants you didn’t know
      you needed. In particular, many professionals are tapping into the talents
      of semi-autonomous software systems called AI agents, which can call on AI
      at specific points to solve problems and complete tasks.AI agents are
      particularly effective when they use large language models (LLMs) because
      those systems are powerful, efficient, and adaptable. One way to program
      such technology is by describing in code what you want your system to do
      (the “workflow”), including when it should use an LLM. If you were a
      software company trying to revamp your old codebase to use a more modern
      programming language for better optimizations and safety, you might build
      a system that uses an LLM to translate the codebase one file at a time,
      testing each file as you go.But what happens when LLMs make mistakes?
      You’ll want the agent to backtrack to make another attempt, incorporating
      lessons it learned from previous mistakes. Coding this up can take as much
      effort as implementing the original agent; if your system for translating
      a codebase contained thousands of lines of code, then you’d be making
      thousands of lines of code changes or additions to support the logic for
      backtracking when LLMs make mistakes.

  - title: AI-powered solar aquaculture reveals a scalable pathway for food, energy
      and climate action
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-powered-solar-aquaculture-reveals.html
    summary: Researchers in Taiwan demonstrate that installing solar panels above
      clam ponds can simultaneously support aquaculture and renewable energy
      under increasing climate stress. Using real-world farm data, the study
      shows that moderate shading lowers pond temperatures, reduces water
      demand, and generates clean electricity. This reveals novel, practical
      synergies across the water–energy–food–climate–land nexus.

      teaching us about AI"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-bot-social-media-platform-moltbook.html
    summary: What happens when you create a social media platform that only AI bots
      can post to? The answer, it turns out, is both entertaining and
      concerning. Moltbook is exactly that—a platform where artificial
      intelligence agents chat among themselves and humans can only watch from
      the sidelines.

  - title: “Quantum Twins” Simulate What Supercomputers Can’t
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-twins
    summary: "While quantum computers continue to slowly grind toward usefulness,
      some are pursuing a different approach—analog quantum simulation. This
      path doesn’t offer complete control of single bits of quantum information,
      known as qubits—it is not a universal quantum computer. Instead, quantum
      simulators directly mimic complex, difficult-to-access things, like
      individual molecules, chemical reactions, or novel materials. What analog
      quantum simulation lacks in flexibility, it makes up for in feasibility:
      quantum simulators are ready now."

  - title: Brain-inspired AI helps soft robot arms switch tasks and stay stable
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-brain-ai-soft-robot-arms.html
    summary: Researchers have developed an AI control system that enables soft
      robotic arms to learn a wide repertoire of motions and tasks once, then
      adjust to new scenarios on the fly without needing retraining or
      sacrificing functionality. This breakthrough brings soft robotics closer
      to human-like adaptability for real-world applications, such as in
      assistive robotics, rehabilitation robots, and wearable or medical soft
      robots, by making them more intelligent, versatile, and safe. The research
      team includes Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's (SMART)
      Mens, Manus & Machina (M3S) interdisciplinary research group, and National
      University of Singapore (NUS), alongside collaborators from Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology (MIT) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU
      Singapore).

  - title: 3D-printed metamaterials that stretch and fail by design
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/3d-printed-metamaterials-stretch-and-fail-design-0204
    summary: Metamaterials — materials whose properties are primarily dictated by
      their internal microstructure, and not their chemical makeup — have been
      redefining the engineering materials space for the last decade. To date,
      however, most metamaterials have been lightweight options designed for
      stiffness and strength.

  - title: Scientists just mapped the hidden structure holding the Universe together
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260203020205.htm
    summary: Astronomers have produced the most detailed map yet of dark matter,
      revealing the invisible framework that shaped the Universe long before
      stars and galaxies formed. Using powerful new observations from NASA’s
      James Webb Space Telescope, the research shows how dark matter gathered
      ordinary matter into dense regions, setting the stage for galaxies like
      the Milky Way and eventually planets like Earth.

    summary: A new light-based breakthrough could help quantum computers finally
      scale up. Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that
      efficiently collect light from individual atoms, allowing many qubits to
      be read at once. The team has already demonstrated working arrays with
      dozens and even hundreds of cavities. The approach could eventually
      support massive quantum networks with millions of qubits.

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
