  - title: Tougher solid electrolyte advances long-sought lithium metal batteries
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-tougher-solid-electrolyte-advances-sought.html
    summary: A solid—rather than liquid—electrolyte between the opposite electrodes
      of a battery should, in theory, enable a rechargeable lithium metal
      battery that is safer, packs much more energy, and charges considerably
      faster than the lithium-ion batteries commercially available today.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-roboreward-dataset-automate-robotic.html
    summary: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has opened
      new possibilities for the development of robots that can reliably tackle
      various everyday tasks. Training and evaluating these algorithms, however,
      typically requires extensive efforts, as humans still need to manually
      label training data and assess the performance of models in both
      simulations and real-world experiments.

  - title: How everyday foam reveals the secret logic of artificial intelligence
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260114084109.htm
    summary: Foams were once thought to behave like glass, with bubbles frozen in
      place at the microscopic level. But new simulations reveal that foam
      bubbles are always shifting, even while the foam keeps its overall shape.
      Remarkably, this restless motion follows the same math used to train
      artificial intelligence. The finding hints that learning-like behavior may
      be a fundamental principle shared by materials, machines, and living
      cells.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/continued-commitment-to-understanding-intelligence-0114
    summary: The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in
      the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from
      across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence
      through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These
      researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering,
      the humanities, and more.

      solutions
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-framework-ai-recover-optimal-solutions.html
    summary: 'If you use consumer AI systems, you have likely experienced something
      like AI "brain fog": You are well into a conversation when suddenly the AI
      seems to lose track of the different ideas you have been talking about and
      how they fit together.'

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214317.htm
    summary: A generative AI system can now analyze blood cells with greater
      accuracy and confidence than human experts, detecting subtle signs of
      diseases like leukemia. It not only spots rare abnormalities but also
      recognizes its own uncertainty, making it a powerful support tool for
      clinicians.

  - title: Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: 2.009 mechanical engineering students embrace “cycles”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
