  - title: New electrolyzer turns plastic-waste syngas into ethylene with less energy
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-electrolyzer-plastic-syngas-ethylene-energy.html
    summary: For every ton of ethylene created, one ton of carbon dioxide is
      produced. With more than 300 million tons of ethylene produced each year,
      the production system has a huge carbon footprint that scientists and
      engineers are eager to reduce and eventually eliminate. A new device
      developed in Ted Sargent's lab at Northwestern takes a step toward
      breaking that cycle.

      design could mean for mechanical engineering
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-machine-heart-automated-mechanism.html
    summary: Can you design a mechanism that will trace out the shape of a heart?
      How about the shape of a moon, or a star? Mechanism design—the art of
      assembling linkages and joints to create machines with prescribed
      motion—is one of the quintessential activities of mechanical engineers,
      but has resisted automation for almost two centuries.

      record-breaking 6-meter LOFTID inflatable aeroshell. Learn how COMSOL
      Multiphysics® was used to perform inverse analysis on flight thermocouple
      data, validating heat flux gauges and preflight CFD predictions. Attendees
      will gain technical insights into improving thermal models for future HIAD
      missions, making this essential for engineers seeking to advance
      atmospheric reentry design. The session concludes with a live Q&A.

  - title: Robot hand approaches human-like dexterity with new visual-tactile training
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-robot-approaches-human-dexterity-visual.html
    summary: Human hands are a wonder of nature and unmatched in the animal kingdom.
      They can twist caps, flick switches, handle tiny objects with ease, and
      perform thousands of tasks every day. Robot hands struggle to keep up.
      They typically miss the sense of touch, can't move many fingers at once,
      and lose track of what they are holding when their fingers block their
      camera's view. Scientists have now developed a smarter way to train a
      robot's brain to give its hands human-like dexterity.

    summary: Seven MIT researchers are among the 130 new members and 28
      international members recently elected to the National Academy of
      Engineering (NAE) for 2026. Twelve additional MIT alumni were also elected

    summary: As patients and employers look for alternatives to pricey GLP-1 drugs,
      Silicon Valley startup Twin Health is using AI and wearable sensors to
      help people make healthier choices.

  - title: Why 'zero-knowledge encryption' may not stop password theft if servers
      are hacked
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-knowledge-encryption-password-theft-servers.html
    summary: People who regularly use online services have between 100 and 200
      passwords. Very few can remember every single one. Password managers are
      therefore extremely helpful, allowing users to access all their passwords
      with just a single master password.

    summary: In December, NASA took another small, incremental step towards
      autonomous surface rovers. In a demonstration, the Perseverance team used
      AI to generate the rover’s waypoints. Perseverance used the AI waypoints
      on two separate days, traveling a total of 456 meters without human
      control.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260213223923.htm
    summary: Neuromorphic computers modeled after the human brain can now solve the
      complex equations behind physics simulations — something once thought
      possible only with energy-hungry supercomputers. The breakthrough could
      lead to powerful, low-energy supercomputers while revealing new secrets
      about how our brains process information.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
