  - title: Guided learning lets “untrainable” neural networks realize their potential
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/guided-learning-lets-untrainable-neural-networks-realize-their-potential-1218
    summary: Even networks long considered “untrainable” can learn effectively with
      a bit of a helping hand. Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and
      Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have shown that a brief period
      of alignment between neural networks, a method they call guidance, can
      dramatically improve the performance of architectures previously thought
      unsuitable for modern tasks.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217082503.htm
    summary: "After a decade of painstaking measurements, scientists have delivered
      a major plot twist in particle physics: a long-hypothesized “mystery
      particle” likely doesn’t exist. Using the MicroBooNE experiment at
      Fermilab, researchers analyzed neutrinos from two powerful beams and found
      no evidence for a sterile neutrino, ruling it out with 95% certainty."

  - title: AI detects cancer but it’s also reading who you are
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217231230.htm
    summary: AI tools designed to diagnose cancer from tissue samples are quietly
      learning more than just disease patterns. New research shows these systems
      can infer patient demographics from pathology slides, leading to biased
      results for certain groups. The bias stems from how the models are trained
      and the data they see, not just from missing samples. Researchers also
      demonstrated a way to significantly reduce these disparities.

  - title: iRobot’s Cofounder Weighs In on Company’s Bankruptcy
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-bankruptcy-colin-angle-amazon
    summary: On Sunday evening, the legendary robotics company iRobot, manufacturer
      of the Roomba robotic vacuum, filed for bankruptcy. The company will be
      handing over all of its assets to its Chinese manufacturing partner,
      Picea. According to iRobot’s press release, “this agreement represents a
      critical step toward strengthening iRobot’s financial foundation and
      positioning the Company for long-term growth and innovation,” which sounds
      like the sort of thing that you put in a press release when you’re trying
      your best to put a positive spin on really, really bad news.

  - title: This AI Can Beat You At Rock-Paper-Scissors
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-reservoir-computer
    summary: Rock-paper-scissors is often a game of psychology, reverse psychology,
      reverse-reverse psychology, and chance. But what if a computer could
      understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido
      University and the TDK Corp. (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan,
      has designed a chip that can do just that.

  - title: Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081949.htm
    summary: Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a
      century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics.
      Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures
      behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence,
      percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics
      now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the
      universe.

    summary: Computer-aided design (CAD) systems are tried-and-true tools used to
      design many of the physical objects we use each day. But CAD software
      requires extensive expertise to master, and many tools incorporate such a
      high level of detail they don’t lend themselves to brainstorming or rapid
      prototyping.

    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
