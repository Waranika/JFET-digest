  - title: Origami-inspired ring lets users 'feel' virtual worlds
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-origami-users-virtual-worlds.html
    summary: Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are technologies that
      allow users to immerse themselves in digital worlds or enhance their
      surroundings with computer-generated filters or images, respectively. Both
      these technologies are now widely used worldwide, whether to experience
      video games and media content in more engaging ways or improve specific
      training and assist professionals in their daily tasks.

  - title: Researchers tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083356.htm
    summary: "A massive new study comparing more than 100,000 people with today’s
      most advanced AI systems delivers a surprising result: generative AI can
      now beat the average human on certain creativity tests. Models like GPT-4
      showed strong performance on tasks designed to measure original thinking
      and idea generation, sometimes outperforming typical human responses. But
      there’s a clear ceiling. The most creative humans — especially the top 10%
      — still leave AI well behind, particularly on richer creative work like
      poetry and storytelling."

  - title: “No-cloning” Workaround Could Enable Quantum Cloud
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/no-cloning-workaround
    summary: One of the many quirks of quantum mechanics is that unknown quantum
      states can’t be copied, which presents major challenges for both quantum
      computing and quantum communications. Now, researchers have shown they can
      bypass this restriction by encrypting qubits as they clone them, which
      could provide powerful new capabilities including a quantum equivalent of
      cloud storage.

  - title: Scientists twist tiny crystals to control electricity
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125081138.htm
    summary: Researchers have developed a technique that allows them to carve
      complex three dimensional nanodevices directly from single crystals. To
      demonstrate its power, they sculpted microscopic helices from a magnetic
      material and found that the structures behave like switchable diodes.
      Electric current prefers one direction, but the effect can be flipped by
      changing the magnetization or the twist of the helix. The findings show
      that geometry itself can be used as a tool for electronic design.

  - title: No One Is Quite Sure Why Ice Is Slippery
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/no-one-is-quite-sure-why-ice-is-slippery/
    summary: A thin, watery layer coating the surface of ice is what makes it slick.
      Despite a great deal of theorizing over the centuries, though, it isn't
      entirely clear why that layer forms.

  - title: Swarms of mini robots that 'bloom' could lead to adaptive architecture
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-swarms-mini-robots-bloom-architecture.html
    summary: Nature is, of course, the master engineer—been there, seen it, solved
      it. While we struggle to design buildings that don't overheat or feel like
      concrete cages, nature has been perfecting comfortable living structures
      for ages. Now scientists are borrowing from the natural world again; this
      time, to build a swarm of interconnected mini-robots that could lead to
      buildings with dynamic facades that respond to sunlight and the people
      inside.

  - title: AI is already writing almost one-third of new software code, study shows
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-software-code.html
    summary: "Generative AI is reshaping software development—and fast. A new study
      published in Science shows that AI-assisted coding is spreading rapidly,
      though unevenly: in the U.S., the share of new code relying on AI rose
      from 5% in 2022 to 29% in early 2025, compared with just 12% in China. AI
      usage is highest among less experienced programmers, but productivity
      gains go to seasoned developers."

      instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand
      over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what large language models
      (LLMs) do."

  - title: Electrifying boilers to decarbonize industry
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/atmoszero-electrifies-boilers-to-decarbonize-industry-0121
    summary: More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial
      Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial
      activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by
      burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant
      percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of
      paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

    summary: Quantum computers could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to
      business analytics—but their incredible power also makes them surprisingly
      vulnerable. New research from Penn State warns that today’s quantum
      machines are not just futuristic tools, but potential gold mines for
      hackers. The study reveals that weaknesses can exist not only in software,
      but deep within the physical hardware itself, where valuable algorithms
      and sensitive data may be exposed.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
