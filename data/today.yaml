  - title: New AI-based technology offers real-time electric vehicle state
      estimation for safer driving
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-based-technology-real-electric.html
    summary: A research team led by Professor Kanghyun Nam from the Department of
      Robotics and Mechanical Engineering at DGIST has developed a physical
      AI-based vehicle state estimation technology that accurately estimates the
      driving state of electric vehicles in real time.

  - title: The origami wheel that could explore lunar caves
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-origami-wheel-explore-lunar-caves.html
    summary: Beneath the moon's cratered surface lie networks of lava tubes and deep
      pits, natural caves that could shelter future lunar bases from cosmic
      radiation and wild temperature swings. These underground structures
      represent some of the most scientifically valuable areas in the solar
      system, but they come with the very real challenge of simply getting
      there.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-deepfakes.html
    summary: Over the course of 2025, deepfakes improved dramatically. AI-generated
      faces, voices and full-body performances that mimic real people increased
      in quality far beyond what even many experts expected would be the case
      just a few years ago. They were also increasingly used to deceive people.

  - title: AI models stumble on basic multiplication without special training
      methods, study finds
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-stumble-basic-multiplication-special.html
    summary: These days, large language models can handle increasingly complex
      tasks, writing complex code and engaging in sophisticated reasoning. But
      when it comes to four-digit multiplication, a task taught in elementary
      school, even state-of-the-art systems fail. Why?

  - title: First Air Taxi Service to Launch in Dubai in 2026
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/joby-air-taxi
    summary: Ten years ago, ride-sharing giant Uber embraced a sci-fi future in
      which clean, quiet electric aircraft would shuttle passengers around
      crowded cities. Uber’s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included a
      white paper and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched
      the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) industry, promising
      investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying
      taxis were “closer than you think.”

  - title: Large Hadron Collider finally explains how fragile matter forms
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082727.htm
    summary: "In collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, hotter than the Sun’s
      core by a staggering margin, scientists have finally solved a
      long-standing mystery: how delicate particles like deuterons and their
      antimatter twins can exist at all. Instead of forming in the initial
      chaos, these fragile nuclei are born later, when the fireball cools, from
      the decay of ultra-short-lived, high-energy particles."

  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

  - title: "MIT in the media: 2025 in review "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-media-review-1222
    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
