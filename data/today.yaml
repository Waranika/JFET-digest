  - title: Why comparisons between AI and human intelligence miss the point
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-comparisons-ai-human-intelligence.html
    summary: Claims that artificial intelligence (AI) is on the verge of surpassing
      human intelligence have become commonplace. According to some
      commentators, rapid advances in large language models signal an imminent
      tipping point—often framed as "superintelligence"—that will fundamentally
      reshape society.

  - title: Stabilized iron catalyst could replace platinum in hydrogen fuel cells
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-stabilized-iron-catalyst-platinum-hydrogen.html
    summary: Japan and California have embraced hydrogen fuel-cell technologies, a
      form of renewable energy that can be used in vehicles and for supplying
      clean energy to manufacturing sectors. But the technology remains
      expensive due to its reliance on precious metals such as platinum.
      Engineers at Washington University in St. Louis are working on this
      challenge, finding ways to stabilize ubiquitous iron components for use in
      fuel cells to replace the expensive platinum metals, which would make
      hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles more affordable.

    summary: Red and blue states alike have introduced legislation in recent weeks
      that would halt data center development, citing concerns from climate to
      high energy prices.

  - title: “This is science!” – MIT president talks about the importance of
      America’s research enterprise on GBH’s Boston Public Radio
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/science-mit-president-talks-about-importance-americas-research-enterprise-gbhs-boston-public
    summary: In a wide-ranging live conversation, MIT President Sally Kornbluth
      joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan live in studio for GBH’s Boston Public
      Radio on Thursday, February 5. They talked about MIT, the pressures facing
      America’s research enterprise, the importance of science, that
      Congressional hearing on antisemitism in 2023, and more – including
      Sally’s experience as a Type 1 diabetic.

  - title: Scientists create smart synthetic skin that can hide images and change
      shape
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206034836.htm
    summary: Inspired by the shape-shifting skin of octopuses, Penn State
      researchers developed a smart hydrogel that can change appearance,
      texture, and shape on command. The material is programmed using a special
      printing technique that embeds digital instructions directly into the
      skin. Images and information can remain invisible until triggered by heat,
      liquids, or stretching.

  - title: "AI-powered companionship: Harnessing music and empathetic speech in
      robots to combat loneliness"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-powered-companionship-harnessing-music.html
    summary: Loneliness has a critical impact on the mental health of citizens,
      particularly among the elderly. Robots capable of perceiving and
      responding to human emotions can serve as heart-warming companions to help
      lift the spirits. A research team at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University
      (PolyU) has discovered that the combined power of music and empathetic
      speech in robots with artificial intelligence (AI) could foster a stronger
      bond between humans and machines. These findings underscore the importance
      of a multimodal approach in designing empathetic robots, offering
      significant implications for their application in health support, elder
      care, education and beyond.

  - title: A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm
    summary: Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to
      disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to
      perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than
      pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice
      surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing
      control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up
      into something truly powerful.

      teaching us about AI"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-bot-social-media-platform-moltbook.html
    summary: What happens when you create a social media platform that only AI bots
      can post to? The answer, it turns out, is both entertaining and
      concerning. Moltbook is exactly that—a platform where artificial
      intelligence agents chat among themselves and humans can only watch from
      the sidelines.

  - title: “Quantum Twins” Simulate What Supercomputers Can’t
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-twins
    summary: "While quantum computers continue to slowly grind toward usefulness,
      some are pursuing a different approach—analog quantum simulation. This
      path doesn’t offer complete control of single bits of quantum information,
      known as qubits—it is not a universal quantum computer. Instead, quantum
      simulators directly mimic complex, difficult-to-access things, like
      individual molecules, chemical reactions, or novel materials. What analog
      quantum simulation lacks in flexibility, it makes up for in feasibility:
      quantum simulators are ready now."

      that artificial intelligence could crack one of biology’s deepest
      mysteries: how a string of amino acids folds itself into a working
      molecular machine."

  - title: Scientists just mapped the hidden structure holding the Universe together
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260203020205.htm
    summary: Astronomers have produced the most detailed map yet of dark matter,
      revealing the invisible framework that shaped the Universe long before
      stars and galaxies formed. Using powerful new observations from NASA’s
      James Webb Space Telescope, the research shows how dark matter gathered
      ordinary matter into dense regions, setting the stage for galaxies like
      the Milky Way and eventually planets like Earth.

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."

      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent

      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."
