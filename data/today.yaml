  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

  - title: Reinforcement learning accelerates model-free training of optical AI
      systems
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-free-optical-ai.html
    summary: "Optical computing has emerged as a powerful approach for high-speed
      and energy-efficient information processing. Diffractive optical networks,
      in particular, enable large-scale parallel computation through the use of
      passive structured phase masks and the propagation of light. However, one
      major challenge remains: systems trained in model-based simulations often
      fail to perform optimally in real experimental settings, where
      misalignments, noise, and model inaccuracies are difficult to capture."

  - title: Understanding why quick clay is so unstable may lead to safer, greener
      stabilization methods
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-quick-clay-unstable-safer-greener.html
    summary: Quick clay collapse can be both dangerous and costly. New research will
      help us understand more about why the clay is so unstable. And maybe what
      we can do about it.

  - title: 11 Amazing Engineering Events in 2026
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-technology-2026
    summary: Elon Musk says his company Neuralink is aiming to restore partial sight
      to fully blind patients in 2026. The company plans to test its newest and
      most powerful implant, Blindsight, in humans early this year. The chip
      will be wirelessly connected to an external video camera and implanted
      into the brain’s visual cortex. Bypassing the eyes, it is designed to
      generate the perception of vision based on what the camera captures, even
      for people born blind. The resulting vision will be low resolution in
      early tests but will hopefully get better over time, Musk says, though
      some experts worry he is overpromising on the quality of the
      brain-computer interface.

      explains student errors
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-accurately-grades-messy-handwritten.html
    summary: A research team affiliated with UNIST has unveiled a novel AI system
      capable of grading and providing detailed feedback on even the most untidy
      handwritten math answers—much like a human instructor.

  - title: From individuals to crews, AI brings teamwork into construction
      productivity analysis
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-individuals-crews-ai-teamwork-productivity.html
    summary: Researchers at National Taiwan University have developed an AI system
      that recognizes construction activities at both the individual and crew
      levels using ordinary site videos. The approach reveals how teamwork
      shapes productivity and provides a foundation for future human–robot
      collaboration on construction sites.

  - title: Large Hadron Collider finally explains how fragile matter forms
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082727.htm
    summary: "In collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, hotter than the Sun’s
      core by a staggering margin, scientists have finally solved a
      long-standing mystery: how delicate particles like deuterons and their
      antimatter twins can exist at all. Instead of forming in the initial
      chaos, these fragile nuclei are born later, when the fireball cools, from
      the decay of ultra-short-lived, high-energy particles."

  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
