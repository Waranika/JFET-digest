  - title: Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a ten-fold reduction in
      inference costs and a four-fold reduction in how many GPUs it would take
      to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

      next-gen superalloys
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-neutron-diffraction-unveils-relay-hardening.html
    summary: As the aerospace sector pursues propulsion systems that are cleaner,
      quieter, and more efficient, materials used in turbine components face
      increasingly demanding thermal and mechanical environments. Ni-Co-based
      superalloys are widely regarded as prime candidates for next-generation
      turbine disks due to their exceptional ability to retain strength under
      extreme temperature and stress.

  - title: Discrete spatial diffusion models data while obeying scientific principles
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-discrete-spatial-diffusion-obeying-scientific.html
    summary: Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a new
      approach that addresses the limitations of generative AI models. Unlike
      generative diffusion models, the team's Discrete Spatial Diffusion
      approach honors scientific and physics principles. The team validated
      their model on two challenging scientific applications—subsurface rock
      microstructures and lithium-ion battery electrodes—with promising results.

  - title: This simple design change could finally fix solid-state batteries
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231331.htm
    summary: Scientists in South Korea have discovered a way to make all-solid-state
      batteries safer and more powerful using inexpensive materials. Instead of
      adding costly metals, they redesigned the battery’s internal structure to
      help lithium ions move faster. This simple structural tweak boosted
      performance by up to four times. The work points to cheaper, safer
      batteries for phones, electric vehicles, and beyond.

  - title: Stanford’s AI spots hidden disease warnings that show up while you sleep
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260109023114.htm
    summary: Stanford researchers have developed an AI that can predict future
      disease risk using data from just one night of sleep. The system analyzes
      detailed physiological signals, looking for hidden patterns across the
      brain, heart, and breathing. It successfully forecast risks for conditions
      like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. The results suggest sleep
      contains early health warnings doctors have largely overlooked.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/3-questions-how-ai-could-optimize-power-grid-0109
    summary: Artificial intelligence has captured headlines recently for its rapidly
      growing energy demands, and particularly the surging electricity usage of
      data centers that enable the training and deployment of the latest
      generative AI models. But it’s not all bad news — some AI tools have the
      potential to reduce some forms of energy consumption and enable cleaner
      grids.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

    summary: This whitepaper provides MEMS engineers, biomedical device developers,
      and multiphysics simulation specialists with a practical AI-accelerated
      workflow for optimizing piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers
      (PMUTs), enabling you to explore complex design trade-offs between
      sensitivity and bandwidth while achieving validated performance

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
