  - title: Ultrahigh solid loading enables high precision ceramic parts
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ultrahigh-solid-enables-high-precision.html
    summary: National Taiwan University researchers have developed an
      ultrahigh-solid-loading (83 vol%) yet highly flowable suspension for 3D
      printing that produces ceramic parts with extremely low shrinkage and 100%
      density, overcoming a major barrier in precision ceramic manufacturing.

  - title: AI can generate a feeling of intimacy that exceeds human connections
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-generate-intimacy-exceeds-human.html
    summary: People can develop emotional closeness to artificial intelligence
      (AI)—under certain conditions, even more so than to other people. This is
      shown by a new study conducted by a research team led by Prof. Dr. Markus
      Heinrichs and Dr. Tobias Kleinert from the Department of Psychology at the
      University of Freiburg and Prof. Dr. Bastian Schiller from Heidelberg
      University's Institute of Psychology. Participants felt a sense of
      closeness especially when they did not know that they were communicating
      with AI. The results have been published in Communications Psychology.

  - title: Great Refractor Initiative Looks to AI to Harden Critical Code
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-rust-great-refractor
    summary: "Many of the world’s critical IT systems remain riddled with bugs, and
      AI tools threaten to make it easier than ever to exploit them. But AI
      could also be part of the solution: A new initiative aims to automatically
      convert vulnerable code into the security-focused language Rust, which
      would eliminate the vast majority of known software vulnerabilities."

  - title: Emoticons can confuse LLMs, causing 'silent failures' in coding responses
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-emoticons-llms-silent-failures-coding.html
    summary: Large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
      can process and generate texts in various languages, are now widely used
      by people worldwide. These models have proved to be effective in rapidly
      sourcing information, answering questions, creating written content for
      specific applications and writing computer code.

  - title: AI that talks to itself learns faster and smarter
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260127112130.htm
    summary: AI may learn better when it’s allowed to talk to itself. Researchers
      showed that internal “mumbling,” combined with short-term memory, helps AI
      adapt to new tasks, switch goals, and handle complex challenges more
      easily. This approach boosts learning efficiency while using far less
      training data. It could pave the way for more flexible, human-like AI
      systems.

  - title: Welcome to the “most wicked” apprentice program on campus
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/pappalardo-most-wicked-apprentice-program-campus-0128
    summary: The Pappalardo Apprentice program pushes the boundaries of the
      traditional lab experience, inviting a selected group of juniors and
      seniors to advance their fabrication skills while also providing mentor
      training and peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities in an environment fueled
      by creativity, safety, and fun.

      thinks it might change your mind
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ready-robots-homes-maker-friendly.html
    summary: As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding
      its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like "eyebrows" and
      offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the
      sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.

  - title: Distant entangled atoms acting as one sensor deliver stunning precision
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260126075842.htm
    summary: Researchers have demonstrated that quantum entanglement can link atoms
      across space to improve measurement accuracy. By splitting an entangled
      group of atoms into separate clouds, they were able to measure
      electromagnetic fields more precisely than before. The technique takes
      advantage of quantum connections acting at a distance. It could enhance
      tools such as atomic clocks and gravity sensors.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
