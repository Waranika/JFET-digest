    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-perovskite-based-betavoltaic-battery-high.html
    summary: A research team led by Professor Su-Il In of the Department of Energy
      Science & Engineering at DGIST has achieved a breakthrough improvement in
      the performance of the radiation absorber, a key component of
      perovskite-based betavoltaic batteries, by applying additive engineering
      and antisolvent process control techniques.

    summary: The data inputs that enable modern search and recommendation systems
      were thought to be secure, but an algorithm developed by Cornell Tech
      researchers successfully teased out names, medical diagnoses and financial
      information from encoded datasets.

      minimal data
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-motion-robots-human-dexterity-minimal.html
    summary: Despite rapid robotic automation advancements, most systems struggle to
      adapt their pre-trained movements to dynamic environments with objects of
      varying stiffness or weight. To tackle this challenge, researchers from
      Japan have developed an adaptive motion reproduction system using Gaussian
      process regression.

  - title: This AI spots dangerous blood cells doctors often miss
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214317.htm
    summary: A generative AI system can now analyze blood cells with greater
      accuracy and confidence than human experts, detecting subtle signs of
      diseases like leukemia. It not only spots rare abnormalities but also
      recognizes its own uncertainty, making it a powerful support tool for
      clinicians.

  - title: This strange form of water may power giant planets’ magnetic fields
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214308.htm
    summary: At extreme pressures and temperatures, water becomes superionic — a
      solid that behaves partly like a liquid and conducts electricity. This
      unusual form is believed to shape the magnetic fields of Uranus and
      Neptune and may be the most common type of water in the solar system. New
      high-precision experiments show its atomic structure is far messier than
      expected, combining multiple crystal patterns instead of one clean
      arrangement. The finding reshapes models of icy planets both near and far.

  - title: Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: "3 Questions: How AI could optimize the power grid"
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/3-questions-how-ai-could-optimize-power-grid-0109
    summary: Artificial intelligence has captured headlines recently for its rapidly
      growing energy demands, and particularly the surging electricity usage of
      data centers that enable the training and deployment of the latest
      generative AI models. But it’s not all bad news — some AI tools have the
      potential to reduce some forms of energy consumption and enable cleaner
      grids.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
