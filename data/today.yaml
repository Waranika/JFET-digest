  - title: Grok created three million sexualized images, research says
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-grok-million-sexualized-images.html
    summary: Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok generated an estimated three million
      sexualized images of women and children in a matter of days, researchers
      said Thursday, revealing the scale of the explicit content that sparked a
      global outcry.

  - title: AI is already writing almost one-third of new software code, study shows
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-software-code.html
    summary: "Generative AI is reshaping software development—and fast. A new study
      published in Science shows that AI-assisted coding is spreading rapidly,
      though unevenly: in the U.S., the share of new code relying on AI rose
      from 5% in 2022 to 29% in early 2025, compared with just 12% in China. AI
      usage is highest among less experienced programmers, but productivity
      gains go to seasoned developers."

  - title: How to Compute With Electron Waves
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/plasmon-computing-device
    summary: "Much has been made of the excessive power demands of AI, but solutions
      are sparse. This has led engineers to consider completely new paradigms in
      computing: optical, thermodynamic, reversible—the list goes on. Many of
      these approaches require a change in the materials used for computation,
      which would demand an overhaul in the CMOS fabrication techniques used
      today."

    summary: "Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and
      says: “I’ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous
      instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand
      over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what large language models
      (LLMs) do."

  - title: This new building material pulls carbon out of the air
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260121034148.htm
    summary: A new building material developed by engineers at Worcester Polytechnic
      Institute could change how the world builds. Made using an enzyme that
      turns carbon dioxide into solid minerals, the material cures in hours and
      locks away carbon instead of releasing it. It’s strong, repairable,
      recyclable, and far cleaner than concrete. If adopted widely, it could
      slash emissions across the construction industry.

  - title: The human brain may work more like AI than anyone expected
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000308.htm
    summary: Scientists have discovered that the human brain understands spoken
      language in a way that closely resembles how advanced AI language models
      work. By tracking brain activity as people listened to a long podcast,
      researchers found that meaning unfolds step by step—much like the layered
      processing inside systems such as GPT-style models.

    summary: More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial
      Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial
      activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by
      burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant
      percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of
      paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

  - title: Unbreakable? Researchers warn quantum computers have serious security flaws
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000330.htm
    summary: Quantum computers could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to
      business analytics—but their incredible power also makes them surprisingly
      vulnerable. New research from Penn State warns that today’s quantum
      machines are not just futuristic tools, but potential gold mines for
      hackers. The study reveals that weaknesses can exist not only in software,
      but deep within the physical hardware itself, where valuable algorithms
      and sensitive data may be exposed.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
