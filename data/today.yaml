  - title: "3 Questions: Using AI to help Olympic skaters land a quint"
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/3-questions-using-ai-help-olympic-skaters-land-quint-0210
    summary: Olympic figure skating looks effortless. Athletes sail across the ice,
      then soar into the air, spinning like a top, before landing on a single
      blade just 4-5 millimeters wide. To help figure skaters land quadruple
      axels, Salchows, Lutzes, and maybe even the elusive quintuple without
      looking the least bit stressed, Jerry Lu MFin ’24 developed an optical
      tracking system called OOFSkate that uses artificial intelligence to
      analyze video of a figure skater’s jump and make recommendations on how to
      improve. Lu, a former researcher at the MIT Sports Lab, has been aiding
      elite skaters on Team USA with their technical performance and will be
      working with NBC Sports during the 2026 Winter Olympics to help
      commentators and TV viewers make better sense of the complex scoring
      system in figure skating, snowboarding, and skiing. He’ll be applying AI
      technologies to explain nuanced judging decisions and demonstrate just how
      technically challenging these sports can be.

      responsive shape morphing implants"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-harnessing-degradation-pave-precise-responsive.html
    summary: An international research team has demonstrated a new approach to
      4D-printed shape-morphing implants that opens the door to increasingly
      personalized health care.  The findings, outlined in the journal Additive
      Manufacturing, highlight how material degradation can be used to trigger
      controlled shape change of implanted material.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-decision-aids-neutral-users.html
    summary: Guidance based on artificial intelligence (AI) may be uniquely placed
      to foster biases in humans, leading to less effective decision making, say
      researchers, who found that people with a positive view of AI may be at
      higher risk of being misled by AI tools. The study, titled "Examining
      Human Reliance on Artificial Intelligence in Decision Making," is
      published in Scientific Reports.

      bends
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-rotating-nozzle-3d-air-powered.html
    summary: Soft robots made out of flexible, biocompatible materials are in high
      demand in industries from health care to manufacturing, but precisely
      designing and controlling such robots for specific purposes is a perennial
      challenge. What if you could 3D print a soft robot with predictable
      shape-morphing capabilities already built in? Harvard 3D printing experts
      have shown it's possible.

  - title: Small modular reactors gain competitive edge with new digital twin
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-small-modular-reactors-gain-competitive.html
    summary: Advanced nuclear is within reach—and a new digital twin reveals how
      smarter plant operations can enhance the economic viability and safety of
      small modular reactors, or SMRs. In collaboration with the University of
      Tennessee and GE Vernova Hitachi, researchers at Oak Ridge National
      Laboratory recently published research in the journal Nuclear Science and
      Engineering on a new risk-informed digital twin designed to enhance
      operational decision-making for the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR
      design.

  - title: New Devices Might Scale the Memory Wall
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-and-memory-wall
    summary: The hunt is on for anything that can surmount AI’s perennial memory
      wall–even quick models are bogged down by the time and energy needed to
      carry data between processor and memory. Resistive RAM (RRAM)could
      circumvent the wall by allowing computation to happen in the memory
      itself. Unfortunately, most types of this nonvolatile memory are too
      unstable and unwieldy for that purpose.

    summary: New York state has required companies to disclose if “technological
      innovation or automation” was the cause of job loss for nearly a year. So
      far, none has.

  - title: Scientists finally solve a 100-year-old mystery in the air we breathe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208011019.htm
    summary: "Scientists at the University of Warwick have cracked a long-standing
      problem in air pollution science: how to predict the movement of
      irregularly shaped nanoparticles as they drift through the air we breathe.
      These tiny particles — from soot and microplastics to viruses — are linked
      to serious health risks, yet most models still treat them as perfect
      spheres for simplicity. By reworking a century-old formula, researchers
      have created the first simple, accurate way to predict how particles of
      almost any shape behave."

  - title: Scientists create smart synthetic skin that can hide images and change
      shape
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206034836.htm
    summary: Inspired by the shape-shifting skin of octopuses, Penn State
      researchers developed a smart hydrogel that can change appearance,
      texture, and shape on command. The material is programmed using a special
      printing technique that embeds digital instructions directly into the
      skin. Images and information can remain invisible until triggered by heat,
      liquids, or stretching.

  - title: A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm
    summary: Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to
      disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to
      perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than
      pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice
      surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing
      control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up
      into something truly powerful.

    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
