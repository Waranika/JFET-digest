      'thinking'"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-artificial-metacognition-ai-ability.html
    summary: Have you ever had the experience of rereading a sentence multiple times
      only to realize you still don't understand it? As taught to scores of
      incoming college freshmen, when you realize you're spinning your wheels,
      it's time to change your approach.

  - title: Elastic metasurface can capture multiple frequencies at once
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-elastic-metasurface-capture-multiple-frequencies.html
    summary: "It has long been considered common sense that a single device performs
      only one function. Just as tuning a radio to a different frequency changes
      the channel, systems that manipulate waves have traditionally been
      designed to operate at only one specific frequency, requiring different
      devices for different frequencies. Now, however, researchers have opened
      up a new possibility: a single thin plate can simultaneously distinguish
      elastic waves of multiple frequencies and precisely direct each of them to
      different locations."

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-unpredictable-movements-autonomous-robots-human.html
    summary: A research team from the Visual Perception and Cognition Laboratory and
      the Cognitive Neurotechnology Unit at Toyohashi University of Technology
      investigated how the movements of autonomous mobile robots influence human
      emotional responses during passing encounters in virtual reality (VR)
      environments.

      road, so what comes next?"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-law-famous-road.html
    summary: For half a century, computing advanced in a reassuring, predictable
      way. Transistors—devices used to switch electrical signals on a computer
      chip—became smaller. Consequently, computer chips became faster, and
      society quietly assimilated the gains almost without noticing.

  - title: Distant entangled atoms acting as one sensor deliver stunning precision
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260126075842.htm
    summary: Researchers have demonstrated that quantum entanglement can link atoms
      across space to improve measurement accuracy. By splitting an entangled
      group of atoms into separate clouds, they were able to measure
      electromagnetic fields more precisely than before. The technique takes
      advantage of quantum connections acting at a distance. It could enhance
      tools such as atomic clocks and gravity sensors.

      access, and perilous for millions of women who are abused with the
      technology.

  - title: Researchers tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083356.htm
    summary: "A massive new study comparing more than 100,000 people with today’s
      most advanced AI systems delivers a surprising result: generative AI can
      now beat the average human on certain creativity tests. Models like GPT-4
      showed strong performance on tasks designed to measure original thinking
      and idea generation, sometimes outperforming typical human responses. But
      there’s a clear ceiling. The most creative humans — especially the top 10%
      — still leave AI well behind, particularly on richer creative work like
      poetry and storytelling."

  - title: “No-cloning” Workaround Could Enable Quantum Cloud
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/no-cloning-workaround
    summary: One of the many quirks of quantum mechanics is that unknown quantum
      states can’t be copied, which presents major challenges for both quantum
      computing and quantum communications. Now, researchers have shown they can
      bypass this restriction by encrypting qubits as they clone them, which
      could provide powerful new capabilities, including a quantum equivalent of
      cloud storage.

  - title: No One Is Quite Sure Why Ice Is Slippery
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/no-one-is-quite-sure-why-ice-is-slippery/
    summary: A thin, watery layer coating the surface of ice is what makes it slick.
      Despite a great deal of theorizing over the centuries, though, it isn't
      entirely clear why that layer forms.

    summary: "Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and
      says: “I’ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous
      instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand
      over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what large language models
      (LLMs) do."

  - title: Electrifying boilers to decarbonize industry
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/atmoszero-electrifies-boilers-to-decarbonize-industry-0121
    summary: More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial
      Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial
      activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by
      burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant
      percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of
      paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000330.htm
    summary: Quantum computers could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to
      business analytics—but their incredible power also makes them surprisingly
      vulnerable. New research from Penn State warns that today’s quantum
      machines are not just futuristic tools, but potential gold mines for
      hackers. The study reveals that weaknesses can exist not only in software,
      but deep within the physical hardware itself, where valuable algorithms
      and sensitive data may be exposed.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
