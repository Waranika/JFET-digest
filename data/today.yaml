  - title: "MIT in the media: 2025 in review "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-media-review-1222
    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: AI-driven assistant calculates best injection molding settings and
      explains decisions in multiple languages
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-driven-molding-decisions-multiple.html
    summary: Most of the plastic products we use are made through injection molding,
      a process in which molten plastic is injected into a mold to mass-produce
      identical items. However, even slight changes in conditions can lead to
      defects, so the process has long relied on the intuition of highly skilled
      workers.

      models
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-agents-results-large-language.html
    summary: Whether you're a scientist brainstorming research ideas or a CEO hoping
      to automate a task in human resources or finance, you'll find that
      artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming the assistants you didn't
      know you needed. In particular, many professionals are tapping into the
      talents of semi-autonomous software systems called AI agents, which can
      call on AI at specific points to solve problems and complete tasks.

    summary: The company made 80 times as many reports to the National Center for
      Missing & Exploited Children during the first six months of 2025 as it did
      in the same period a year prior.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

  - title: Ultra-low power, fully biodegradable artificial synapse offers
      record-breaking memory
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ultra-power-fully-biodegradable-artificial.html
    summary: In Nature Communications, a research team affiliated with UNIST present
      a fully biodegradable, robust, and energy-efficient artificial synapse
      that holds great promise for sustainable neuromorphic technologies. Made
      entirely from eco-friendly materials sourced from nature—such as shells,
      beans, and plant fibers—this innovation could help address the growing
      problems of electronic waste and high energy use.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Scientists spent 10 years chasing a particle that wasn’t there
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217082503.htm
    summary: "After a decade of painstaking measurements, scientists have delivered
      a major plot twist in particle physics: a long-hypothesized “mystery
      particle” likely doesn’t exist. Using the MicroBooNE experiment at
      Fermilab, researchers analyzed neutrinos from two powerful beams and found
      no evidence for a sterile neutrino, ruling it out with 95% certainty."

  - title: This AI Can Beat You At Rock-Paper-Scissors
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-reservoir-computer
    summary: Rock-paper-scissors is often a game of psychology, reverse psychology,
      reverse-reverse psychology, and chance. But what if a computer could
      understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido
      University and the TDK Corp. (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan,
      has designed a chip that can do just that.

  - title: Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081949.htm
    summary: Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a
      century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics.
      Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures
      behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence,
      percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics
      now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the
      universe.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
