  - title: First Air Taxi Service to Launch in Dubai in 2026
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/joby-air-taxi
    summary: Ten years ago, ride-sharing giant Uber embraced a sci-fi future in
      which clean, quiet electric aircraft would shuttle passengers around
      crowded cities. Uber’s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included a
      white paper and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched
      the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) industry, promising
      investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying
      taxis were “closer than you think.”

  - title: People Who Drink Bottled Water on a Daily Basis Ingest 90,000 More
      Microplastic Particles Each Year
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/people-who-drink-bottled-water-on-a-daily-basis-ingest-90000-more-microplastics-per-year/
    summary: Drinking water in plastic bottles contains countless particles too
      small to see. New research finds that people who drink water from them on
      a daily basis ingest far more microplastics than those who don’t.

  - title: Large Hadron Collider finally explains how fragile matter forms
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082727.htm
    summary: "In collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, hotter than the Sun’s
      core by a staggering margin, scientists have finally solved a
      long-standing mystery: how delicate particles like deuterons and their
      antimatter twins can exist at all. Instead of forming in the initial
      chaos, these fragile nuclei are born later, when the fireball cools, from
      the decay of ultra-short-lived, high-energy particles."

  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

    summary: "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and University of
      Michigan have created the world's smallest fully programmable, autonomous
      robots: microscopic swimming machines that can independently sense and
      respond to their surroundings, operate for months and cost just a penny
      each."

  - title: How ChatGPT could change the face of advertising, without you even
      knowing about it
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-chatgpt-advertising.html
    summary: Online adverts are sometimes so personal that they feel eerie. Even as
      a researcher in this area, I'm slightly startled when I get a message
      asking if my son still needs school shirts a few hours after browsing for
      clothes for my children.

      unavoidable energy costs across all communication channels"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-devices-isnt-cheap-reveals-unavoidable.html
    summary: Every task we perform on a computer—whether number crunching, watching
      a video, or typing out an article—requires different components of the
      machine to interact with one another. "Communication is massively crucial
      for any computation," says former SFI Graduate Fellow Abhishek Yadav, a
      Ph.D. scholar at the University of New Mexico. But scientists don't fully
      grasp how much energy computational devices spend on communication.

  - title: "MIT in the media: 2025 in review "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-media-review-1222
    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
