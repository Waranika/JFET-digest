  - title: Why new kinds of steel are needed to build lead-cooled reactors
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-kinds-steel-cooled-reactors.html
    summary: Safer operation, better fuel efficiency and lower waste mark
      lead-cooled nuclear power as a potentially dramatic shift from the
      water-cooled nuclear stations the world has relied on since the mid 20th
      century. A recent Swedish study casts new light on how to avoid corrosion
      in the steel used to build these next-generation nuclear facilities.

  - title: New method improves the reliability of statistical estimations
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-method-reliability-statistical.html
    summary: MIT researchers have developed a method that generates more accurate
      uncertainty measures for certain types of estimation. This could help
      improve the reliability of data analyses in areas like economics,
      epidemiology, and environmental sciences.

  - title: Ghost Robotics’ Arm Brings Manipulation to Military Quadrupeds
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm
    summary: "Ghost Robotics is today announcing a major upgrade for their Vision 60
      quadruped: an arm. Ghost, a company which originated at the GRASP Lab at
      the University of Pennsylvania, specializes in exceptionally rugged
      quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public
      safety and disaster relief, it also provides robots to the United States
      military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans
      out of danger."

  - title: Tiny Chips Could Lead to Giant Power Savings
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/voltage-regulator
    summary: Even if a GPU in a data center should only require 700 watts to run a
      large language model, it may realistically need 1,700 watts because of
      inefficiencies in how electricity reaches it. That’s a problem Peng Zou
      and his team at startup PowerLattice say they have solved by miniaturizing
      and repackaging high-voltage regulators.

  - title: Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm
    summary: Scientists have uncovered that some atoms in liquids don't move at
      all—even at extreme temperatures—and these anchored atoms dramatically
      alter the way materials freeze. Using advanced electron microscopy,
      researchers watched molten metal droplets solidify and found that
      stationary atoms can trap liquids in tiny “atomic corrals,” keeping them
      fluid far below their normal freezing point and giving rise to a strange
      hybrid state of matter.

  - title: New materials could boost the energy efficiency of microelectronics
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-materials-could-boost-energy-efficiency-microelectronics-1211
    summary: MIT researchers have developed a new fabrication method that could
      enable the production of more energy efficient electronics by stacking
      multiple functional components on top of one existing circuit.

    summary: Prevent costly AI failures in production by mastering data-centric
      approaches to detect bias, classimbalance, and data leakage before
      deployment impacts your business.

  - title: Vine-inspired robotic gripper gently lifts heavy and fragile objects
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-vine-robotic-gripper-gently-heavy.html
    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
