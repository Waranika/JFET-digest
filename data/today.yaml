  - title: New calibration module offers improved measurement of thermoelectric
      device performance
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-calibration-module-thermoelectric-device.html
    summary: A standard reference thermoelectric module (SRTEM) for objectively
      measuring thermoelectric module performance has been developed in Korea
      for the first time. A research team led by Dr. Sang Hyun Park at the Korea
      Institute of Energy Research developed the world's second standard
      reference thermoelectric module, following Japan, and improved its
      performance by more than 20% compared with existing modules, demonstrating
      the excellence of Korea's homegrown technology. The findings are published
      in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

  - title: Next-Level Quantum Computers Will Almost Be Useful
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/neutral-atom-quantum-computing
    summary: The goal of the quantum-computing industry is to build a powerful,
      functional machine capable of solving large-scale problems in science and
      industry that classical computing can’t solve. We won’t get there in 2026.
      In fact, scientists have been working toward that goal since at least the
      1980s, and it has proved difficult, to say the least.

  - title: Physicists made atoms behave like a quantum circuit
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222043243.htm
    summary: Using ultracold atoms and laser light, researchers recreated the
      behavior of a Josephson junction—an essential component of quantum
      computers and voltage standards. The appearance of Shapiro steps in this
      atomic system reveals a deep universality in quantum physics and makes
      elusive microscopic effects visible for the first time.

    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-reservoir-computer
    summary: Rock-paper-scissors is often a game of psychology, reverse psychology,
      reverse-reverse psychology, and chance. But what if a computer could
      understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido
      University and the TDK Corp. (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan,
      has designed a chip that can do just that.

  - title: Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081949.htm
    summary: Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a
      century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics.
      Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures
      behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence,
      percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics
      now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the
      universe.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
