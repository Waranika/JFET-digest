  - title: Parking-aware navigation system could prevent frustration and emissions
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/parking-aware-navigation-could-prevent-frustration-and-emissions-0219
    summary: It happens every day — a motorist heading across town checks a
      navigation app to see how long the trip will take, but they find no
      parking spots available when they reach their destination. By the time
      they finally park and walk to their destination, they’re significantly
      later than they expected to be.

  - title: Research project launches free tool to make AI safer and more trustworthy
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-free-tool-ai-safer-trustworthy.html
    summary: A University of Glasgow-led research project is releasing a free tool
      to help organizations, policymakers, and the public maximize the benefits
      of AI applications while identifying their potential harms. The tool,
      developed as part of the Participatory Harm Auditing Workbenches and
      Methodologies (PHAWM) project, aims to help address the urgent need for
      rigorous assessments of AI risks caused by the rapid expansion and
      adoption of the technology across a wide range of sectors.

  - title: Laser-etched glass can store data for for 10,000 years, Microsoft says
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-laser-etched-glass-years-microsoft.html
    summary: Thousands of years from now, what will remain of our digital era? The
      ever-growing vastness of human knowledge is no longer stored in libraries,
      but on hard drives that struggle to last decades, let alone millennia.

      Proof
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-says-generative-ai-will-save-the-planet-it-doesnt-offer-much-proof/
    summary: A new report finds that of 154 specific claims about how AI will
      benefit the climate, just a quarter cited academic research. A third
      included no evidence at all.

  - title: How can you rescue a 'kidnapped' robot? New AI system helps robots regain
      their sense of location
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-kidnapped-robot-ai-robots-regain.html
    summary: "Mobile robots must continuously estimate their position to navigate
      autonomously. However, satellite-based navigation systems are not always
      reliable: signals may degrade near buildings or become unavailable
      indoors. To operate safely and efficiently, robots must interpret their
      surroundings using onboard sensors and robust localization algorithms."

    summary: Seven MIT researchers are among the 130 new members and 28
      international members recently elected to the National Academy of
      Engineering (NAE) for 2026. Twelve additional MIT alumni were also elected

  - title: Why 'zero-knowledge encryption' may not stop password theft if servers
      are hacked
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-knowledge-encryption-password-theft-servers.html
    summary: People who regularly use online services have between 100 and 200
      passwords. Very few can remember every single one. Password managers are
      therefore extremely helpful, allowing users to access all their passwords
      with just a single master password.

  - title: Brain inspired machines are better at math than expected
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260213223923.htm
    summary: Neuromorphic computers modeled after the human brain can now solve the
      complex equations behind physics simulations — something once thought
      possible only with energy-hungry supercomputers. The breakthrough could
      lead to powerful, low-energy supercomputers while revealing new secrets
      about how our brains process information.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
