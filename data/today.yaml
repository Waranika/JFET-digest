  - title: Human-led AI opens tech jobs for refugees
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-human-ai-tech-jobs-refugees.html
    summary: AI can help displaced people avoid exploitation, but humans must call
      the shots, warn experts. For Susan Achiech, life began in Kenya's Kakuma
      refugee camp, where her South Sudanese parents fled to for safety in the
      early 1990s. Now 26, she lives in Canada, running her own gaming company,
      Tech Femme Algorithms, while working as an insurance advisor and studying
      gaming programming.

  - title: When Will AI Agents Be Ready for Autonomous Business Operations?
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-benchmarks
    summary: AI agents abound—and they’re increasingly gaining autonomy. From
      navigating the web to recursively improving its own coding skills, agentic
      AI promises to reorder the online economy and redefine the internet.

  - title: Can desert sand be used to build houses and roads?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-sand-houses-roads.html
    summary: "The world may be running out of sand suitable for concrete.
      Researchers are therefore testing a possible solution for using desert
      sand as a material. Ren Wei and several researchers at NTNU and the
      University of Tokyo have made a prototype of a new material: botanical
      sand concrete. It combines desert sand with plant-based additives and is
      made by pressing desert sand and tiny pieces of wood together, along with
      heat. Their paper is published in the Journal of Building Engineering."

  - title: Scientists found a way to cool quantum computers using noise
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260129080418.htm
    summary: Quantum computers need extreme cold to work, but the very systems that
      keep them cold also create noise that can destroy fragile quantum
      information. Scientists in Sweden have now flipped that problem on its
      head by building a tiny quantum refrigerator that actually uses noise to
      drive cooling instead of fighting it. By carefully steering heat at
      unimaginably small scales, the device can act as a refrigerator, heat
      engine, or energy amplifier inside quantum circuits.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/this-chinese-startup-wants-to-build-a-new-brain-computer-interface-no-implant-required-gestalta/
    summary: Gestala is the latest company to emerge from China’s burgeoning
      brain-computer interface industry. It plans to access the brain with
      noninvasive ultrasound technology.

  - title: Great Refactor Initiative Looks to AI to Harden Critical Code
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-rust-great-refactor
    summary: "Many of the world’s critical IT systems remain riddled with bugs, and
      AI tools threaten to make it easier than ever to exploit them. But AI
      could also be part of the solution: A new initiative aims to automatically
      convert vulnerable code into the security-focused language Rust, which
      would eliminate the vast majority of known software vulnerabilities."

  - title: Emoticons can confuse LLMs, causing 'silent failures' in coding responses
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-emoticons-llms-silent-failures-coding.html
    summary: Large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
      can process and generate texts in various languages, are now widely used
      by people worldwide. These models have proved to be effective in rapidly
      sourcing information, answering questions, creating written content for
      specific applications and writing computer code.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/pappalardo-most-wicked-apprentice-program-campus-0128
    summary: The Pappalardo Apprentice program pushes the boundaries of the
      traditional lab experience, inviting a selected group of juniors and
      seniors to advance their fabrication skills while also providing mentor
      training and peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities in an environment fueled
      by creativity, safety, and fun.

  - title: Not ready for robots in homes? The maker of a friendly new humanoid
      thinks it might change your mind
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ready-robots-homes-maker-friendly.html
    summary: As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding
      its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like "eyebrows" and
      offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the
      sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.

  - title: Distant entangled atoms acting as one sensor deliver stunning precision
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260126075842.htm
    summary: Researchers have demonstrated that quantum entanglement can link atoms
      across space to improve measurement accuracy. By splitting an entangled
      group of atoms into separate clouds, they were able to measure
      electromagnetic fields more precisely than before. The technique takes
      advantage of quantum connections acting at a distance. It could enhance
      tools such as atomic clocks and gravity sensors.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

  - title: “Wait, we have the tech skills to build that”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/building-with-tech-skills-julianna-schneider-1219
    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
