  - title: "3 Questions: Using computation to study the world’s best single-celled
      chemists"
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-yunha-hwang-using-computation-study-worlds-best-single-celled-chemists-1215
    summary: Today, out of an estimated 1 trillion species on Earth, 99.999 percent
      are considered microbial — bacteria, archaea, viruses, and single-celled
      eukaryotes. For much of our planet’s history, microbes ruled the Earth,
      able to live and thrive in the most extreme of environments. Researchers
      have only just begun in the last few decades to contend with the diversity
      of microbes — it’s estimated that less than 1 percent of known genes have
      laboratory-validated functions. Computational approaches offer researchers
      the opportunity to strategically parse this truly astounding amount of
      information.

    summary: The National Academy of Inventors (NAI) has named nine MIT affiliates
      as members of the 2025 class of NAI Fellows. They include Ahmad Bahai, an
      MIT professor of the practice in the Department of Electrical Engineering
      and Computer Science (EECS), and Kripa K. Varanasi, MIT professor in the
      Department of Mechanical Engineering, as well as seven additional MIT
      alumni. NAI fellowship is the highest professional distinction awarded
      solely to inventors.

  - title: How 3D printing creates stronger vehicle parts by solving aluminum's
      high-temperature weakness
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-3d-stronger-vehicle-aluminum-high.html
    summary: Aluminum is prized for being lightweight and strong, but at high
      temperatures it loses strength. This has limited its use in engines,
      turbines, and other applications where parts must stay strong under high
      temperature conditions. Researchers at Nagoya University have developed a
      method that uses metal 3D printing to create a new aluminum alloy series
      optimized for high strength and heat resistance. All new alloys use
      low-cost, abundant elements, and are recycling-friendly, with one variant
      staying both strong and flexible at 300° C.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-software-big-centers-ai.html
    summary: EPFL researchers have developed new software—now spun-off into a
      start-up—that eliminates the need for data to be sent to third-party cloud
      services when AI is used to complete a task. This could challenge the
      business model of Big Tech.

  - title: Sub-millimeter-sized robots can sense, 'think' and act on their own
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-millimeter-sized-robots.html
    summary: Robots small enough to travel autonomously through the human body to
      repair damaged sites may seem the stuff of science fiction dreams. But
      this vision of surgery on a microscale is a step closer to reality, with
      news that researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the
      University of Michigan have built a robot smaller than a millimeter that
      has an onboard computer and sensors.

  - title: Enabling small language models to solve complex reasoning tasks
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-enabling-small-language-complex-tasks.html
    summary: As language models (LMs) improve at tasks like image generation, trivia
      questions, and simple math, you might think that human-like reasoning is
      around the corner. In reality, they still trail us by a wide margin on
      complex tasks. Try playing Sudoku with one, for instance, where you fill
      in numbers one through nine in such a way that each appears only once
      across the columns, rows, and sections of a nine-by-nine grid. Your AI
      opponent will either fail to fill in boxes on its own or do so
      inefficiently, although it can verify if you've filled yours out
      correctly.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/radiation-detection-systems-are-quietly-running-in-the-background-all-around-you/
    summary: If a major disaster like Fukushima or Chornobyl ever happens again, the
      world would know almost straight away, thanks to an array of government
      and DIY radiation-monitoring programs running globally.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032615.htm
    summary: Researchers used a deep learning AI model to uncover the first
      imaging-based biomarker of chronic stress by measuring adrenal gland
      volume on routine CT scans. This new metric, the Adrenal Volume Index,
      correlates strongly with cortisol levels, allostatic load, perceived
      stress, and even long-term cardiovascular outcomes, including heart
      failure risk.

  - title: Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm
    summary: Scientists have uncovered that some atoms in liquids don't move at
      all—even at extreme temperatures—and these anchored atoms dramatically
      alter the way materials freeze. Using advanced electron microscopy,
      researchers watched molten metal droplets solidify and found that
      stationary atoms can trap liquids in tiny “atomic corrals,” keeping them
      fluid far below their normal freezing point and giving rise to a strange
      hybrid state of matter.

    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
