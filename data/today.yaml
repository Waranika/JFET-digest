  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

  - title: Researchers create world's smallest programmable, autonomous robots
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-world-smallest-programmable-autonomous-robots.html
    summary: "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and University of
      Michigan have created the world's smallest fully programmable, autonomous
      robots: microscopic swimming machines that can independently sense and
      respond to their surroundings, operate for months and cost just a penny
      each."

  - title: How ChatGPT could change the face of advertising, without you even
      knowing about it
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-chatgpt-advertising.html
    summary: Online adverts are sometimes so personal that they feel eerie. Even as
      a researcher in this area, I'm slightly startled when I get a message
      asking if my son still needs school shirts a few hours after browsing for
      clothes for my children.

  - title: "For computational devices, talk isn't cheap: Research reveals
      unavoidable energy costs across all communication channels"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-devices-isnt-cheap-reveals-unavoidable.html
    summary: Every task we perform on a computer—whether number crunching, watching
      a video, or typing out an article—requires different components of the
      machine to interact with one another. "Communication is massively crucial
      for any computation," says former SFI Graduate Fellow Abhishek Yadav, a
      Ph.D. scholar at the University of New Mexico. But scientists don't fully
      grasp how much energy computational devices spend on communication.

  - title: Physicists made atoms behave like a quantum circuit
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222043243.htm
    summary: Using ultracold atoms and laser light, researchers recreated the
      behavior of a Josephson junction—an essential component of quantum
      computers and voltage standards. The appearance of Shapiro steps in this
      atomic system reveals a deep universality in quantum physics and makes
      elusive microscopic effects visible for the first time.

  - title: "MIT in the media: 2025 in review "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-media-review-1222
    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/building-with-tech-skills-julianna-schneider-1219
    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
