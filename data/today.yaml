    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/exploring-promise-of-regenerative-aquaculture-arkansas-fish-farm-0217
    summary: "In many academic circles, innovation is imagined as a lab-to-market
      pipeline that travels through patent filings, venture rounds, and coastal
      research hubs. But a growing movement inside U.S. universities is pushing
      students toward a different frontier: solving real engineering problems
      alongside rural communities whose challenges directly shape national food
      security."

  - title: Can AI fulfill our emotional needs?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-fulfill-emotional.html
    summary: Fully customizable virtual companions or avatars—and even "digital
      clones" of deceased people or living ex-partners—are among the new
      possibilities that artificial intelligence is bringing to the love lives
      of humans. But the use of AI in romance isn't limited to these extreme
      cases. Human–AI relationships fall along a broad spectrum that also
      includes dating apps that apply algorithms to predict compatibility and
      help users make the best possible use of their online dating time.

  - title: Review finds 1–2 nm closed pores can boost hard carbon sodium storage
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-nm-pores-boost-hard-carbon.html
    summary: As the global transition toward clean energy accelerates, the demand
      for sustainable, low-cost, and scalable energy storage technologies
      continues to grow. While lithium-ion batteries have dominated the market
      for decades, concerns over lithium resource availability and cost
      volatility are driving intense research into alternative chemistries.

  - title: Why 'zero-knowledge encryption' may not stop password theft if servers
      are hacked
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-knowledge-encryption-password-theft-servers.html
    summary: People who regularly use online services have between 100 and 200
      passwords. Very few can remember every single one. Password managers are
      therefore extremely helpful, allowing users to access all their passwords
      with just a single master password.

  - title: AI robot vehicles learn to team up and extinguish fires in early trial
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-robot-vehicles-team-extinguish.html
    summary: Fighting fires could be done remotely without the need to place
      firefighting crews directly in potentially dangerous situations by using
      collaborative teams of artificial intelligence-powered robots with
      extinguishing equipment on board, with an initial soft trial of the
      technology proving successful.

    summary: When Alan DeKok began a side project in network security, he didn’t
      expect to start a 27-year career. In fact, he didn’t initially set out to
      work in computing at all.

  - title: NASA Let AI Drive the Perseverance Rover
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/perseverance-rover-nasa-anthropic-ai
    summary: In December, NASA took another small, incremental step towards
      autonomous surface rovers. In a demonstration, the Perseverance team used
      AI to generate the rover’s waypoints. Perseverance used the AI waypoints
      on two separate days, traveling a total of 456 meters without human
      control.

      injected into AI search summaries is leading people down potentially
      harmful paths.

  - title: Brain inspired machines are better at math than expected
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260213223923.htm
    summary: Neuromorphic computers modeled after the human brain can now solve the
      complex equations behind physics simulations — something once thought
      possible only with energy-hungry supercomputers. The breakthrough could
      lead to powerful, low-energy supercomputers while revealing new secrets
      about how our brains process information.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
