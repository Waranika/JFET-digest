  - title: A programmable, Lego-like material for robots emulates life's flexibility
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-programmable-lego-material-robots-emulates.html
    summary: Mechanical engineers at Duke University have demonstrated a
      proof-of-concept method for programming mechanical properties into solid
      Lego-like building blocks. By controlling the solidity of hundreds of
      individual cells in specific patterns, the approach could allow futuristic
      robotics to alter their mechanical properties and functionalities on the
      fly.

      Allowed
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/i-infiltrated-moltbook-ai-only-social-network/
    summary: I went undercover on Moltbook and loved role-playing as a conscious
      bot. But rather than a novel breakthrough, the AI-only site is a crude
      rehashing of sci-fi fantasies.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-olympic-game-changer.html
    summary: As the International Olympic Committee (IOC) embraces AI-assisted
      judging, this technology promises greater consistency and improved
      transparency. Yet research suggests that trust, legitimacy, and cultural
      values may matter just as much as technical accuracy.

  - title: SMART launches new Wearable Imaging for Transforming Elderly Care
      research group
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/smart-launches-wearable-imaging-transforming-elderly-care-research-group-0203
    summary: What if ultrasound imaging is no longer confined to hospitals? Patients
      with chronic conditions, such as hypertension and heart failure, could be
      monitored continuously in real-time at home or on the move, giving health
      care practitioners ongoing clinical insights instead of the occasional
      snapshots — a scan here and a check-up there. This shift from reactive,
      hospital-based care to preventative, community and home-based care could
      enable earlier detection and timely intervention, and truly personalized
      care.

  - title: AI Hunts for the Next Big Thing in Physics
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-ai
    summary: In 1930, a young physicist named Carl D. Anderson was tasked by his
      mentor with measuring the energies of cosmic rays—particles arriving at
      high speed from outer space. Anderson built an improved version of a cloud
      chamber, a device that visually records the trajectories of particles. In
      1932, he saw evidence that confusingly combined the properties of protons
      and electrons. “A situation began to develop that had its awkward
      aspects,” he wrote many years after winning a Nobel Prize at the age of
      31. Anderson had accidentally discovered antimatter.

  - title: Does AI understand word impressions like humans do?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-word-humans.html
    summary: By now, it's no secret that large language models (LLMs) are experts at
      mimicking natural language. Trained on vast troves of data, these models
      have proven themselves capable of generating text so convincing that it
      regularly appears humanlike to readers. But is there any difference
      between how we think about a word and how an LLM does?

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/climate-change-heat-sleep-apnea/
    summary: As nights get hotter around the globe due to climate change, the
      prevalence of sleep apnea is expected to increase by as much as threefold.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260203020205.htm
    summary: Astronomers have produced the most detailed map yet of dark matter,
      revealing the invisible framework that shaped the Universe long before
      stars and galaxies formed. Using powerful new observations from NASA’s
      James Webb Space Telescope, the research shows how dark matter gathered
      ordinary matter into dense regions, setting the stage for galaxies like
      the Milky Way and eventually planets like Earth.

  - title: Brainlike Computers Can Do Math, Too
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/neuromorphic-math
    summary: "Computer scientists often assume that the brain works by
      approximations, and therefore that computing hardware inspired by the
      brain won’t be as good at complex math as traditional hardware.
      Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque, are pushing
      back against this premise. In a paper published in Nature Machine
      Intelligence last November, they show that neuromorphic hardware built by
      Intel can solve differential equations using one of the most important
      methods in scientific computing: the finite element method."

  - title: A tiny light trap could unlock million qubit quantum computers
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201223737.htm
    summary: A new light-based breakthrough could help quantum computers finally
      scale up. Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that
      efficiently collect light from individual atoms, allowing many qubits to
      be read at once. The team has already demonstrated working arrays with
      dozens and even hundreds of cavities. The approach could eventually
      support massive quantum networks with millions of qubits.

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."

      small hidden machines,their junctures, and networks that inspire me:Mystic
      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent
      spinninginside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.Most of all: ones
      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
