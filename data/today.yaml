  - title: Should the US be worried about AI bubble?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-1.html
    summary: Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Oracle have been
      taking on enormous new debt in a race to build out their artificial
      intelligence ventures in the last year, fueling Wall Street fears of a
      bubble capable of disrupting the entire economy.

  - title: AI-powered robotic hands learn dexterity by mimicking human movements and
      anatomy
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-powered-robotic-dexterity-mimicking.html
    summary: Step inside the Soft Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich, and you find yourself
      in a space that is part children's nursery, part high-tech workshop and
      part cabinet of curiosities. The lab benches are strewn with foam blocks,
      stuffed animals—including a cuddly squid—and other colorful toys used to
      train robotic dexterity. Piled up on every surface are sensors, cables and
      measurement devices. Skeletal fingers, on show in display cases or
      attached to powerful robotic arms, seem to reach out to grab you from
      every corner.

  - title: More safety and comfort for protective clothing thanks to auxetic fabrics
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-safety-comfort-auxetic-fabrics.html
    summary: When everyday materials are pulled, they stretch or elongate in the
      direction of the pull and become narrower in cross-section. We can also
      observe this property in two-dimensional textiles. Auxetic structures
      behave differently here. They have the striking property of not changing
      under tensile stress or even increasing their width or thickness. These
      properties are advantageous, for example, in protective textiles or
      textile filter media.

  - title: iRobot’s Cofounder Weighs In on Company’s Bankruptcy
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-bankruptcy-colin-angle-amazon
    summary: On Sunday evening, the legendary robotics company iRobot, manufacturer
      of the Roomba robotic vacuum, filed for bankruptcy. The company will be
      handing over all of its assets to its Chinese manufacturing partner,
      Picea. According to iRobot’s press release, “this agreement represents a
      critical step toward strengthening iRobot’s financial foundation and
      positioning the Company for long-term growth and innovation,” which sounds
      like the sort of thing that you put in a press release when you’re trying
      your best to put a positive spin on really, really bad news.

    summary: As OpenAI scrambles to improve ChatGPT, it's ditching a feature in its
      free tier that contributed to last summer's user revolt.

  - title: This AI Can Beat You At Rock-Paper-Scissors
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-reservoir-computer
    summary: Rock-paper-scissors is often a game of psychology, reverse psychology,
      reverse-reverse psychology, and chance. But what if a computer could
      understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido
      University and the TDK Corp. (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan,
      has designed a chip that can do just that.

  - title: Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081949.htm
    summary: Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a
      century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics.
      Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures
      behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence,
      percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics
      now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the
      universe.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216043957.htm
    summary: A newly developed AI can predict which diseases specific genetic
      mutations are likely to cause, not just whether they are harmful. The
      breakthrough could speed up diagnoses and open new paths for personalized
      treatment.

  - title: "“Robot, make me a chair” "
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/robot-makes-chair-1216
    summary: Computer-aided design (CAD) systems are tried-and-true tools used to
      design many of the physical objects we use each day. But CAD software
      requires extensive expertise to master, and many tools incorporate such a
      high level of detail they don’t lend themselves to brainstorming or rapid
      prototyping.

  - title: Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm
    summary: Scientists have uncovered that some atoms in liquids don't move at
      all—even at extreme temperatures—and these anchored atoms dramatically
      alter the way materials freeze. Using advanced electron microscopy,
      researchers watched molten metal droplets solidify and found that
      stationary atoms can trap liquids in tiny “atomic corrals,” keeping them
      fluid far below their normal freezing point and giving rise to a strange
      hybrid state of matter.

    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
