  - title: Why the future of AI depends on trust, safety, and system quality
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-future-ai-safety-quality.html
    summary: When Daniel Graham, an associate professor in the University of
      Virginia School of Data Science, talks about the future of intelligent
      systems, he does not begin with the usual vocabulary of cybersecurity or
      threat mitigation. Instead, he focuses on quality assurance and on how to
      build digital and physical systems we can trust.

  - title: "'TransMiter' technique transplants learned knowledge between AI models"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-transmiter-technique-transplants-knowledge-ai.html
    summary: How inconvenient would it be if you had to manually transfer every
      contact and photo from scratch every time you switched to a new
      smartphone? Current artificial intelligence (AI) models face a similar
      predicament. Whenever a superior new AI model—such as a new version of
      ChatGPT—emerges, it has to be retrained with massive amounts of data and
      at a high cost to acquire specialized knowledge in specific fields. Now a
      Korean research team has developed a "knowledge transplantation"
      technology between AI models that can resolve this inefficiency.

  - title: Not ready for robots in homes? The maker of a friendly new humanoid
      thinks it might change your mind
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ready-robots-homes-maker-friendly.html
    summary: As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding
      its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like "eyebrows" and
      offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the
      sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermodynamic-computing-for-ai
    summary: Generative AI tools such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion
      create photorealistic images. However, they burn lavish amounts of energy.
      Now a pair of studies finds that so-called thermodynamic computing might
      generate images using one ten billionth the energy.

  - title: Synthetic 'muscle' with microfluidic blood vessels shows promise for soft
      robotics
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-synthetic-muscle-microfluidic-blood-vessels.html
    summary: Researchers are continuing to make progress on developing a new
      synthetic material that behaves like biological muscle, an advancement
      that could provide a path to soft robotics, prosthetic devices and
      advanced human-machine interfaces. Their research, recently published in
      Advanced Functional Materials, demonstrates a hydrogel-based actuator
      system that combines movement, control and fuel delivery in a single
      integrated platform.

  - title: Scientists say quantum tech has reached its transistor moment
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260127010136.htm
    summary: Quantum technology has reached a turning point, echoing the early days
      of modern computing. Researchers say functional quantum systems now exist,
      but scaling them into truly powerful machines will require major advances
      in engineering and manufacturing. By comparing different quantum
      platforms, the study reveals both impressive progress and steep challenges
      ahead. History suggests the payoff could be enormous—but not immediate.

  - title: Distant entangled atoms acting as one sensor deliver stunning precision
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260126075842.htm
    summary: Researchers have demonstrated that quantum entanglement can link atoms
      across space to improve measurement accuracy. By splitting an entangled
      group of atoms into separate clouds, they were able to measure
      electromagnetic fields more precisely than before. The technique takes
      advantage of quantum connections acting at a distance. It could enhance
      tools such as atomic clocks and gravity sensors.

  - title: Researchers tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083356.htm
    summary: "A massive new study comparing more than 100,000 people with today’s
      most advanced AI systems delivers a surprising result: generative AI can
      now beat the average human on certain creativity tests. Models like GPT-4
      showed strong performance on tasks designed to measure original thinking
      and idea generation, sometimes outperforming typical human responses. But
      there’s a clear ceiling. The most creative humans — especially the top 10%
      — still leave AI well behind, particularly on richer creative work like
      poetry and storytelling."

  - title: No One Is Quite Sure Why Ice Is Slippery
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/no-one-is-quite-sure-why-ice-is-slippery/
    summary: A thin, watery layer coating the surface of ice is what makes it slick.
      Despite a great deal of theorizing over the centuries, though, it isn't
      entirely clear why that layer forms.

  - title: Electrifying boilers to decarbonize industry
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/atmoszero-electrifies-boilers-to-decarbonize-industry-0121
    summary: More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial
      Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial
      activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by
      burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant
      percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of
      paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
