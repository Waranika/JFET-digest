  - title: AI agents debate their way to improved mathematical reasoning
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-agents-debate-mathematical.html
    summary: Large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
      can process and generate texts in various languages, are now widely used
      worldwide to create written content, source information and even to code
      websites or applications. While these models have improved significantly
      over the past couple of years, their answers can sometimes contain factual
      inaccuracies or logical inconsistencies.

  - title: AI finds a hidden stress signal inside routine CT scans
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032615.htm
    summary: Researchers used a deep learning AI model to uncover the first
      imaging-based biomarker of chronic stress by measuring adrenal gland
      volume on routine CT scans. This new metric, the Adrenal Volume Index,
      correlates strongly with cortisol levels, allostatic load, perceived
      stress, and even long-term cardiovascular outcomes, including heart
      failure risk.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-astronomers-find-planets-in-other-solar-systems/
    summary: Even the best telescopes can’t see exoplanets. It’s all about watching
      for jiggly stars, blue shifts, and transits.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/in-a-first-ai-models-analyze-language-as-well-as-a-human-expert/
    summary: If language is what makes us human, what does it mean now that large
      language models have gained “metalinguistic” abilities?

  - title: Enabling small language models to solve complex reasoning tasks
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/enabling-small-language-models-solve-complex-reasoning-tasks-1212
    summary: As language models (LMs) improve at tasks like image generation, trivia
      questions, and simple math, you might think that human-like reasoning is
      around the corner. In reality, they still trail us by a wide margin on
      complex tasks. Try playing Sudoku with one, for instance, where you fill
      in numbers one through nine in such a way that each appears only once
      across the columns, rows, and sections of a nine-by-nine grid. Your AI
      opponent will either fail to fill in boxes on its own or do so
      inefficiently, although it can verify if you’ve filled yours out
      correctly.

      skepticism remains
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-humanoid-robots-center-stage-silicon.html
    summary: Robots have long been seen as a bad bet for Silicon Valley
      investors—too complicated, capital-intensive and "boring, honestly," says
      venture capitalist Modar Alaoui.

      muscles"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-mimicry-fiber-artificial-muscles-outperform.html
    summary: Biological muscles act as flexible actuators, generating force
      naturally and with an impressive range of motion. Unsurprisingly,
      scientists and engineers have been striving to build artificial muscles
      that mimic these abilities. A new review study, published in npj Robotics,
      takes a deep dive into recent developments surrounding fiber-type
      artificial muscles, one of the most life-like types of artificial muscles
      developed so far.

  - title: New MIT program to train military leaders for the AI age
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/applied-ai-program-train-military-leaders-ai-age-1212
    summary: Artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and enable action
      with reduced risk and greater precision, making it a critical tool for
      national security. A new program offered jointly by the MIT departments of
      Mechanical Engineering (Course 2, MechE) and Electrical Engineering and
      Computer Science (Course 6, EECS) will provide breadth and depth in
      technical studies for naval officers, as well as a path for non-naval
      officers studying at MIT, to grow in their understanding of applied AI for
      naval and military applications.

  - title: Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm
    summary: Scientists have uncovered that some atoms in liquids don't move at
      all—even at extreme temperatures—and these anchored atoms dramatically
      alter the way materials freeze. Using advanced electron microscopy,
      researchers watched molten metal droplets solidify and found that
      stationary atoms can trap liquids in tiny “atomic corrals,” keeping them
      fluid far below their normal freezing point and giving rise to a strange
      hybrid state of matter.

    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
