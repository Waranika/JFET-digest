    summary: Standing on a tower overlooking the cliffs of the Cortina downhill
      course, there is someone who is just as involved in the biggest skiing
      races of the Winter Olympics as Mikaela Shiffrin and Breezy Johnson.

  - title: "Why AI may overcomplicate answers: Humans and LLMs show 'addition bias,'
      often choosing extra steps over subtraction"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-overcomplicate-humans-llms-addition.html
    summary: When making decisions and judgments, humans can fall into common
      "traps," known as cognitive biases. A cognitive bias is essentially the
      tendency to process information in a specific way or follow a systematic
      pattern. One widely documented cognitive bias is the so-called addition
      bias, the tendency of people to prefer solving problems by adding elements
      as opposed to removing them, even if subtraction would be simpler and more
      efficient. One example of this is adding more paragraphs or explanations
      to improve an essay or report, even if removing unnecessary sections would
      be more effective.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/perseverance-rover-nasa-anthropic-ai
    summary: In December, NASA took another small, incremental step towards
      autonomous surface rovers. In a demonstration, the Perseverance team used
      AI to generate the rover’s waypoints. Perseverance used the AI waypoints
      on two separate days, traveling a total of 456 meters without human
      control.

  - title: Brain inspired machines are better at math than expected
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260213223923.htm
    summary: Neuromorphic computers modeled after the human brain can now solve the
      complex equations behind physics simulations — something once thought
      possible only with energy-hungry supercomputers. The breakthrough could
      lead to powerful, low-energy supercomputers while revealing new secrets
      about how our brains process information.

  - title: Rule-breaking discovery reveals new way to strengthen metal in extreme
      conditions
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-discovery-reveals-metal-extreme-conditions.html
    summary: There's a reason why blacksmiths fire metals before hammering them.
      Heat always softens metal, making it more malleable and easier to reshape.
      Or does it? In a surprising new study, Northwestern University engineers
      discovered that, in extreme conditions, heat doesn't soften pure metals—it
      strengthens them.

  - title: A new way to make steel could reduce America’s reliance on imports
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/new-way-make-steel-could-reduce-americas-reliance-imports-0213
    summary: America has been making steel from iron ore the same way for hundreds
      of years. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been making enough of it. Today the
      U.S. is the world’s largest steel importer, relying on other countries to
      produce a material that serves as the backbone of our society.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: Startups Are Betting on Orbital Growth for Advanced Electronics
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-orbit-manufacturing
    summary: This past December, the U.K. start-up Space Forge turned on an orbital
      furnace aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite, producing a stream of super-hot
      plasma that could someday enable production of near-ideal semiconductor
      crystals in orbit. Hailed as a breakthrough in orbital manufacturing, the
      milestone is a first for a free-flying commercial satellite and a payload
      not operated by humans.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
