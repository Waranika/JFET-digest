  - title: A new tool is revealing the invisible networks inside cancer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221043216.htm
    summary: "Spanish researchers have created a powerful new open-source tool that
      helps uncover the hidden genetic networks driving cancer. Called RNACOREX,
      the software can analyze thousands of molecular interactions at once,
      revealing how genes communicate inside tumors and how those signals relate
      to patient survival. Tested across 13 different cancer types using
      international data, the tool matches the predictive power of advanced AI
      systems—while offering something rare in modern analytics: clear,
      interpretable explanations that help scientists understand why tumors
      behave the way they do."

  - title: Ultra-low power, fully biodegradable artificial synapse offers
      record-breaking memory
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ultra-power-fully-biodegradable-artificial.html
    summary: In Nature Communications, a research team affiliated with UNIST present
      a fully biodegradable, robust, and energy-efficient artificial synapse
      that holds great promise for sustainable neuromorphic technologies. Made
      entirely from eco-friendly materials sourced from nature—such as shells,
      beans, and plant fibers—this innovation could help address the growing
      problems of electronic waste and high energy use.

  - title: “Wait, we have the tech skills to build that”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/building-with-tech-skills-julianna-schneider-1219
    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Guided learning lets “untrainable” neural networks realize their potential
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/guided-learning-lets-untrainable-neural-networks-realize-their-potential-1218
    summary: Even networks long considered “untrainable” can learn effectively with
      a bit of a helping hand. Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and
      Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have shown that a brief period
      of alignment between neural networks, a method they call guidance, can
      dramatically improve the performance of architectures previously thought
      unsuitable for modern tasks.

  - title: Scientists spent 10 years chasing a particle that wasn’t there
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217082503.htm
    summary: "After a decade of painstaking measurements, scientists have delivered
      a major plot twist in particle physics: a long-hypothesized “mystery
      particle” likely doesn’t exist. Using the MicroBooNE experiment at
      Fermilab, researchers analyzed neutrinos from two powerful beams and found
      no evidence for a sterile neutrino, ruling it out with 95% certainty."

  - title: This AI Can Beat You At Rock-Paper-Scissors
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-reservoir-computer
    summary: Rock-paper-scissors is often a game of psychology, reverse psychology,
      reverse-reverse psychology, and chance. But what if a computer could
      understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido
      University and the TDK Corp. (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan,
      has designed a chip that can do just that.

  - title: Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081949.htm
    summary: Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a
      century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics.
      Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures
      behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence,
      percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics
      now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the
      universe.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
