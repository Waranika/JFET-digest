    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-robot-lip-sync-youtube.html
    summary: Almost half of our attention during face-to-face conversation focuses
      on lip motion. Yet, robots still struggle to move their lips correctly.
      Even the most advanced humanoids make little more than muppet mouth
      gestures—if they have a face at all.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/continued-commitment-to-understanding-intelligence-0114
    summary: The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in
      the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from
      across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence
      through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These
      researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering,
      the humanities, and more.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-highlight-advancements-chemical-looping-fluidized.html
    summary: Traditional techniques of converting fossil fuels for heat and power
      generation and chemical production increase the carbon footprint, harming
      society and the environment. To mitigate this problem, carbon capture and
      storage technologies aimed at lowering carbon dioxide emissions and
      encompassing renewable energy utilization, circular economy, and green
      chemical synthesis are promising.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/neuroscience-procrastination-brain-mechanism-task-avoidance/
    summary: New research has discovered that a neural circuit may explain
      procrastination. Scientists were able to disrupt this connection using a
      drug.

      solutions
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-framework-ai-recover-optimal-solutions.html
    summary: 'If you use consumer AI systems, you have likely experienced something
      like AI "brain fog": You are well into a conversation when suddenly the AI
      seems to lose track of the different ideas you have been talking about and
      how they fit together.'

  - title: This AI spots dangerous blood cells doctors often miss
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214317.htm
    summary: A generative AI system can now analyze blood cells with greater
      accuracy and confidence than human experts, detecting subtle signs of
      diseases like leukemia. It not only spots rare abnormalities but also
      recognizes its own uncertainty, making it a powerful support tool for
      clinicians.

  - title: This strange form of water may power giant planets’ magnetic fields
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112214308.htm
    summary: At extreme pressures and temperatures, water becomes superionic — a
      solid that behaves partly like a liquid and conducts electricity. This
      unusual form is believed to shape the magnetic fields of Uranus and
      Neptune and may be the most common type of water in the solar system. New
      high-precision experiments show its atomic structure is far messier than
      expected, combining multiple crystal patterns instead of one clean
      arrangement. The finding reshapes models of icy planets both near and far.

  - title: Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking
    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: 2.009 mechanical engineering students embrace “cycles”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
