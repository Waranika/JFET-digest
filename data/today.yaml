  - title: Rise of the rice robots—creating active smart materials
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-rice-robots-smart-materials.html
    summary: Rice becomes weaker when compressed quickly, while staying stronger
      under slow pressure—a discovery enabling scientists to design a new
      material that could be used to build "soft" robots that change stiffness
      automatically and protective gear that adapts to impact speed. Researchers
      harnessed this effect to design a new "metamaterial"—an artificially
      engineered composite structure designed to behave in ways impossible for
      natural materials.

  - title: "'Probably' doesn't mean the same thing to your AI as it does to you"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-doesnt-ai.html
    summary: When a human says an event is "probable" or "likely," people generally
      have a shared, if fuzzy, understanding of what that means. But when an AI
      chatbot like ChatGPT uses the same word, it's not assessing the odds the
      way we do, my colleagues and I found.

    summary: In his new book, A World Appears, Michael Pollan argues that artificial
      intelligence can do many things—it just can’t be a person.

  - title: AI’s Math Tricks Don’t Work for Scientific Computing
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/number-formats-ai-scientific-computing
    summary: AI has driven an explosion of new number formats—the ways in which
      numbers are represented digitally. Engineers are looking at every possible
      way to save computation time and energy, including shortening the number
      of bits used to represent data. But what works for AI doesn’t necessarily
      work for scientific computing, be it for computational physics, biology,
      fluid dynamics, or engineering simulations. IEEE Spectrum spoke with Laslo
      Hunhold, who recently joined Barcelona-based Openchip as an AI engineer,
      about his efforts to develop a bespoke number format for scientific
      computing.

  - title: Generative AI analyzes medical data faster than human research teams
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260221060942.htm
    summary: Researchers tested whether generative AI could handle complex medical
      datasets as well as human experts. In some cases, the AI matched or
      outperformed teams that had spent months building prediction models. By
      generating usable analytical code from precise prompts, the systems
      dramatically reduced the time needed to process health data. The findings
      hint at a future where AI helps scientists move faster from data to
      discovery.

  - title: Quantum computer breakthrough tracks qubit fluctuations in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260219040756.htm
    summary: Qubits, the heart of quantum computers, can change performance in
      fractions of a second — but until now, scientists couldn’t see it
      happening. Researchers at NBI have built a real-time monitoring system
      that tracks these rapid fluctuations about 100 times faster than previous
      methods. Using fast FPGA-based control hardware, they can instantly
      identify when a qubit shifts from “good” to “bad.” The discovery opens a
      new path toward stabilizing and scaling future quantum processors.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/neural-blueprint-human-intelligence-in-soft-robots-0219
    summary: A new artificial intelligence control system enables soft robotic arms
      to learn a wide repertoire of motions and tasks once, then adjust to new
      scenarios on the fly, without needing retraining or sacrificing
      functionality.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
