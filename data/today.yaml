  - title: 11 Amazing Engineering Events in 2026
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-technology-2026
    summary: Elon Musk says his company Neuralink is aiming to restore partial sight
      to fully blind patients in 2026. The company plans to test its newest and
      most powerful implant, Blindsight, in humans early this year. The chip
      will be wirelessly connected to an external video camera and implanted
      into the brain’s visual cortex. Bypassing the eyes, it is designed to
      generate the perception of vision based on what the camera captures, even
      for people born blind. The resulting vision will be low resolution in
      early tests but will hopefully get better over time, Musk says, though
      some experts worry he is overpromising on the quality of the
      brain-computer interface.

  - title: Poor Sleep Quality Accelerates Brain Aging
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/poor-sleep-quality-accelerates-brain-aging/
    summary: Research shows that people who sleep poorly tend to have brain age that
      is older than their actual age. Chronic inflammation in the body caused by
      poor sleep likely plays a part.

    summary: "Professor Ole Gunnar Dahlhaug and postdoctoral fellow Wolf Ludwig Kuhn
      at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have three
      goals: To understand the problem of gas supersaturation at hydropower
      plants, to solve it, and to help correct mistakes made during Norway's
      more than 100 years of hydropower production."

  - title: From individuals to crews, AI brings teamwork into construction
      productivity analysis
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-individuals-crews-ai-teamwork-productivity.html
    summary: Researchers at National Taiwan University have developed an AI system
      that recognizes construction activities at both the individual and crew
      levels using ordinary site videos. The approach reveals how teamwork
      shapes productivity and provides a foundation for future human–robot
      collaboration on construction sites.

  - title: Large Hadron Collider finally explains how fragile matter forms
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082727.htm
    summary: "In collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, hotter than the Sun’s
      core by a staggering margin, scientists have finally solved a
      long-standing mystery: how delicate particles like deuterons and their
      antimatter twins can exist at all. Instead of forming in the initial
      chaos, these fragile nuclei are born later, when the fireball cools, from
      the decay of ultra-short-lived, high-energy particles."

  - title: This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm
    summary: A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future
      of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision
      while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s
      made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced
      instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far
      larger and more powerful than anything possible today.

    url: https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-media-review-1222
    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

  - title: This AI finds simple rules where humans see only chaos
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
