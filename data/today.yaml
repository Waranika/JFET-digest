  - title: New design tool 3D-prints woven metamaterials that stretch and fail
      predictably
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-tool-3d-woven-metamaterials.html
    summary: Metamaterials—materials whose properties are primarily dictated by
      their internal microstructure, and not their chemical makeup—have been
      redefining the engineering materials space for the last decade. To date,
      however, most metamaterials have been lightweight options designed for
      stiffness and strength.

  - title: "'Discovery learning' AI tool predicts battery cycle life with just a few
      days' data"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-discovery-ai-tool-battery-life.html
    summary: An agentic AI tool for battery researchers harnesses data from previous
      battery designs to predict the cycle life of new battery concepts. With
      information from just 50 cycles, the tool—developed at University of
      Michigan Engineering—can predict how many charge-discharge cycles the
      battery can undergo before its capacity drops below 90% of its design
      capacity.

    summary: "When AlphaFold solved the protein-folding problem in 2020, it showed
      that artificial intelligence could crack one of biology’s deepest
      mysteries: how a string of amino acids folds itself into a working
      molecular machine."

  - title: A programmable, Lego-like material for robots emulates life's flexibility
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-programmable-lego-material-robots-emulates.html
    summary: Mechanical engineers at Duke University have demonstrated a
      proof-of-concept method for programming mechanical properties into solid
      Lego-like building blocks. By controlling the solidity of hundreds of
      individual cells in specific patterns, the approach could allow futuristic
      robotics to alter their mechanical properties and functionalities on the
      fly.

  - title: Does AI understand word impressions like humans do?
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-word-humans.html
    summary: By now, it's no secret that large language models (LLMs) are experts at
      mimicking natural language. Trained on vast troves of data, these models
      have proven themselves capable of generating text so convincing that it
      regularly appears humanlike to readers. But is there any difference
      between how we think about a word and how an LLM does?

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260203020205.htm
    summary: Astronomers have produced the most detailed map yet of dark matter,
      revealing the invisible framework that shaped the Universe long before
      stars and galaxies formed. Using powerful new observations from NASA’s
      James Webb Space Telescope, the research shows how dark matter gathered
      ordinary matter into dense regions, setting the stage for galaxies like
      the Milky Way and eventually planets like Earth.

  - title: Brainlike Computers Can Do Math, Too
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/neuromorphic-math
    summary: "Computer scientists often assume that the brain works by
      approximations, and therefore that computing hardware inspired by the
      brain won’t be as good at complex math as traditional hardware.
      Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque, are pushing
      back against this premise. In a paper published in Nature Machine
      Intelligence last November, they show that neuromorphic hardware built by
      Intel can solve differential equations using one of the most important
      methods in scientific computing: the finite element method."

  - title: A tiny light trap could unlock million qubit quantum computers
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201223737.htm
    summary: A new light-based breakthrough could help quantum computers finally
      scale up. Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that
      efficiently collect light from individual atoms, allowing many qubits to
      be read at once. The team has already demonstrated working arrays with
      dozens and even hundreds of cavities. The approach could eventually
      support massive quantum networks with millions of qubits.

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."

      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent
      spinninginside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.Most of all: ones
      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."
