  - title: Multi-layer flax fiber fabric developed for alternative seating furniture
      with flexible geometries
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-multi-layer-flax-fiber-fabric.html
    summary: Seating furniture is frequently not designed for long-term use or
      simple assembly and disassembly and has a tendency to break after just one
      move. This does not apply to the benches, chairs, and stools that were
      created as part of the LinumTube cooperation project led by Fraunhofer
      WKI. The goal of the project consortium was to develop ecologically
      sustainable seating furniture for the circular economy.

      his grip over technologies that shape national security, social media, and
      artificial intelligence.

  - title: New AI system fixes 3D printing defects in real time
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-ai-3d-defects-real.html
    summary: Additive manufacturing has revolutionized manufacturing by enabling
      customized, cost-effective products with minimal waste. However, with the
      majority of 3D printers operating on open-loop systems, they are
      notoriously prone to failure. Minor changes, like adjustments to nozzle
      size or print speed, can lead to print errors that mechanically weaken the
      part under production.

      in Grants
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/hhs-is-using-ai-tools-from-palantir-to-target-dei-and-gender-ideology-in-grants/
    summary: Since March of 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services has
      been using tools from Palantir and the startup Credal AI to weed out
      perceived alignment with “DEI” or “gender ideology.”

  - title: A mathematical framework for optimizing robotic joints
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-mathematical-framework-optimizing-robotic-joints.html
    summary: Consider the marvelous physics of the human knee. The largest hinge
      joint in the body, it has two rounded bones held together by ligaments
      that not only swing like a door, but also roll and glide over each other,
      allowing the knee to flex, extend, and balance.

  - title: Brain-like Computers Can Do Math, Too
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/neuromorphic-math
    summary: Computer scientists often assume that the brain works by
      approximations, and therefore that computing hardware inspired by the
      brain won’t be as good at complex math as traditional hardware.
      Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are pushing back against this
      premise. In a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence last
      November, they show that neuromorphic hardware built by Intel can solve
      differential equations using one of the most important methods in
      scientific computing, the finite element method.

  - title: How generative AI can help scientists synthesize complex materials
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/how-generative-ai-can-help-scientists-synthesize-complex-materials-0202
    summary: Generative artificial intelligence models have been used to create
      enormous libraries of theoretical materials that could help solve all
      kinds of problems. Now, scientists just have to figure out how to make
      them.

  - title: A tiny light trap could unlock million qubit quantum computers
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201223737.htm
    summary: A new light-based breakthrough could help quantum computers finally
      scale up. Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that
      efficiently collect light from individual atoms, allowing many qubits to
      be read at once. The team has already demonstrated working arrays with
      dozens and even hundreds of cavities. The approach could eventually
      support massive quantum networks with millions of qubits.

  - title: Inner 'self-talk' helps AI models learn, adapt and multitask more easily
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-multitask-easily.html
    summary: Talking to oneself is a trait which feels inherently human. Our inner
      monologs help us organize our thoughts, make decisions, and understand our
      emotions. But it's not just humans who can reap the benefits of such
      self-talk.

  - title: This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201062455.htm
    summary: Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is
      cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and
      predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts.
      Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly
      bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could
      push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.

  - title: Explore the Stratosphere With a DIY Pico balloon
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."

    summary: "As fairies for the Irish or leeks for Welsh,it’s the secret lives of
      small hidden machines,their junctures, and networks that inspire me:Mystic
      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent
      spinninginside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.Most of all: ones
      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."

  - title: A breakthrough that could make ships nearly unsinkable
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260130041105.htm
    summary: Researchers have found a way to make ordinary aluminum tubes float
      indefinitely, even when submerged for long periods or punched full of
      holes. By engineering the metal’s surface to repel water, the tubes trap
      air inside and refuse to sink, even in rough conditions. The technology
      could eventually be scaled up into floating platforms, ships, or even
      wave-powered energy systems.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
