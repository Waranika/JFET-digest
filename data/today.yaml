  - title: AI overestimates how smart people are, according to economists
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-overestimates-smart-people-economists.html
    summary: Scientists at HSE University have found that current AI models,
      including ChatGPT and Claude, tend to overestimate the rationality of
      their human opponents—whether first-year undergraduate students or
      experienced scientists—in strategic thinking games, such as the Keynesian
      beauty contest. While these models attempt to predict human behavior, they
      often end up playing "too smart" and losing because they assume a higher
      level of logic in people than is actually present.

  - title: "For computational devices, talk isn't cheap: Research reveals
      unavoidable energy costs across all communication channels"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-devices-isnt-cheap-reveals-unavoidable.html
    summary: Every task we perform on a computer—whether number crunching, watching
      a video, or typing out an article—requires different components of the
      machine to interact with one another. "Communication is massively crucial
      for any computation," says former SFI Graduate Fellow Abhishek Yadav, a
      Ph.D. scholar at the University of New Mexico. But scientists don't fully
      grasp how much energy computational devices spend on communication.

  - title: The Top 6 Robotics Stories of 2025
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-robotics-stories-2025
    summary: Usually, I start off these annual highlights posts by saying that it
      was the best year ever for robotics. But this year, I’m not so sure. At
      the end of 2024, it really seemed like AI and humanoid robots were poised
      to make a transformative amount of progress towards some sort of
      practicality. While it’s certainly true that progress has been made, it’s
      hard to rationalize what’s actually happened in 2025 with the amount of
      money and hype that has suffused robotics over the course of the year. And
      for better or worse, humanoids are overshadowing everything else, raising
      questions about what will happen if the companies building them ultimately
      do not succeed.

  - title: Drones Compete to Spot and Extinguish Brushfires
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/wildfire-drones
    summary: To the untrained eye, it did not look like a particularly complicated
      mission. A large black quadcopter drone, more than two meters spanning the
      propeller tips, sat parked on the grass. Nestled between the legs of its
      landing gear was a red balloon filled with water. Not far away, on a
      concrete pad, a stack of wood pallets was ablaze, the flames whipping
      around in a heavy wind. A student at the University of Maryland (UMD)
      would fly the Alta X drone all of about 25 meters to the fire. There it
      would drop the water balloon to extinguish the flames.

    summary: Big AI companies courted controversy by scraping wide swaths of the
      public internet. With the rise of AI agents, the next data grab is far
      more private.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/alphafold-changed-science-after-5-years-its-still-evolving/
    summary: WIRED spoke with DeepMind’s Pushmeet Kohli about the recent past—and
      promising future—of the Nobel Prize-winning research project that changed
      biology and chemistry forever.

  - title: This new 3D chip could break AI’s biggest bottleneck
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223084857.htm
    summary: Researchers have created a new kind of 3D computer chip that stacks
      memory and computing elements vertically, dramatically speeding up how
      data moves inside the chip. Unlike traditional flat designs, this approach
      avoids the traffic jams that limit today’s AI hardware. The prototype
      already beats comparable chips by several times, with future versions
      expected to go much further. Just as important, it was manufactured
      entirely in a U.S. foundry, showing the technology is ready for real-world
      production.

  - title: New calibration module offers improved measurement of thermoelectric
      device performance
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-calibration-module-thermoelectric-device.html
    summary: A standard reference thermoelectric module (SRTEM) for objectively
      measuring thermoelectric module performance has been developed in Korea
      for the first time. A research team led by Dr. Sang Hyun Park at the Korea
      Institute of Energy Research developed the world's second standard
      reference thermoelectric module, following Japan, and improved its
      performance by more than 20% compared with existing modules, demonstrating
      the excellence of Korea's homegrown technology. The findings are published
      in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

    summary: Robots are becoming part of our everyday lives, from health care to
      home assistance. But for humans to truly trust and collaborate with them,
      robots need more than technical skill—they need to understand us.

  - title: Next-Level Quantum Computers Will Almost Be Useful
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/neutral-atom-quantum-computing
    summary: The goal of the quantum-computing industry is to build a powerful,
      functional machine capable of solving large-scale problems in science and
      industry that classical computing can’t solve. We won’t get there in 2026.
      In fact, scientists have been working toward that goal since at least the
      1980s, and it has proved difficult, to say the least.

  - title: Physicists made atoms behave like a quantum circuit
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251222043243.htm
    summary: Using ultracold atoms and laser light, researchers recreated the
      behavior of a Josephson junction—an essential component of quantum
      computers and voltage standards. The appearance of Shapiro steps in this
      atomic system reveals a deep universality in quantum physics and makes
      elusive microscopic effects visible for the first time.

    summary: “At MIT, innovation ranges from awe-inspiring technology to
      down-to-Earth creativity,” noted Chronicle, during a campus visit this
      year for an episode of the program. In 2025, MIT researchers made
      headlines across print publications, podcasts, and video platforms for key
      scientific advances, from breakthroughs in quantum and artificial
      intelligence to new efforts aimed at improving pediatric health care and
      cancer diagnosis.

    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221091237.htm
    summary: A new AI developed at Duke University can uncover simple, readable
      rules behind extremely complex systems. It studies how systems evolve over
      time and reduces thousands of variables into compact equations that still
      capture real behavior. The method works across physics, engineering,
      climate science, and biology. Researchers say it could help scientists
      understand systems where traditional equations are missing or too
      complicated to write down.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
