  - title: 2.009 mechanical engineering students embrace “cycles”
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/product-engineering-students-embrace-cycles-0108
    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

  - title: Decoding the Arctic to predict winter weather
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/decoding-arctic-to-predict-winter-weather-0108
    summary: Every autumn, as the Northern Hemisphere moves toward winter, Judah
      Cohen starts to piece together a complex atmospheric puzzle. Cohen, a
      research scientist in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental
      Engineering (CEE), has spent decades studying how conditions in the Arctic
      set the course for winter weather throughout Europe, Asia, and North
      America. His research dates back to his postdoctoral work with Bacardi and
      Stockholm Water Foundations Professor Dara Entekhabi that looked at snow
      cover in the Siberian region and its connection with winter forecasting.

  - title: An AI approach for single-image-based 3D character animation with
      preserved proportions
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai-approach-image-based-3d.html
    summary: In Proceedings of the SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Conference Papers, a research
      team affiliated with UNIST reports a new AI technology that can animate 3D
      characters to mimic the exact movements shown in a single 2D image, all
      while preserving natural proportions and avoiding distortions. This
      development could reduce the barriers to creating 3D content for the
      metaverse, animation and gaming industries.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-densifies-electrolytes-stabilizing-lithium-anodes.html
    summary: Researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have achieved a
      breakthrough on the path to practical application of lithium metal
      all-solid-state batteries—the next generation of batteries that can store
      more energy, are safer to operate, and charge faster than conventional
      lithium-ion batteries.

      are reluctant to let AI agents stand between them and their users.

  - title: AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding-degrades
    summary: In recent months, I’ve noticed a troubling trend with AI coding
      assistants. After two years of steady improvements, over the course of
      2025, most of the core models reached a quality plateau, and more
      recently, seem to be in decline. A task that might have taken five hours
      assisted by AI, and perhaps ten hours without it, is now more commonly
      taking seven or eight hours, or even longer. It’s reached the point where
      I am sometimes going back and using older versions of large language
      models (LLMs).

  - title: Physicists built a perfect conductor from ultracold atoms
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106224635.htm
    summary: Researchers at TU Wien have discovered a quantum system where energy
      and mass move with perfect efficiency. In an ultracold gas of atoms
      confined to a single line, countless collisions occur—but nothing slows
      down. Instead of diffusing like heat in metal, motion travels cleanly and
      undiminished, much like a Newton’s cradle. The finding reveals a striking
      form of transport that breaks the usual rules of resistance.

  - title: Scientists create robots smaller than a grain of salt that can think
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260105165815.htm
    summary: Researchers have created microscopic robots so small they’re barely
      visible, yet smart enough to sense, decide, and move completely on their
      own. Powered by light and equipped with tiny computers, the robots swim by
      manipulating electric fields rather than using moving parts. They can
      detect temperature changes, follow programmed paths, and even work
      together in groups. The breakthrough marks the first truly autonomous
      robots at this microscopic scale.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
