  - title: Why it’s critical to move beyond overly aggregated machine-learning metrics
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/why-its-critical-to-move-beyond-overly-aggregated-machine-learning-metrics-0120
    summary: MIT researchers have identified significant examples of
      machine-learning model failure when those models are applied to data other
      than what they were trained on, raising questions about the need to test
      whenever a model is deployed in a new setting.

      upends assumptions about heat transport limits
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-newly-metallic-material-thermal-upends.html
    summary: A UCLA-led, multi-institution research team has discovered a metallic
      material with the highest thermal conductivity measured among metals,
      challenging long-standing assumptions about the limits of heat transport
      in metallic materials.

  - title: Findings on phonetic reduction in speech could help make AI voices more
      natural-sounding
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-phonetic-reduction-speech-ai-voices.html
    summary: A speech study by a research team from The University of Texas at El
      Paso has identified an underappreciated aspect of speech in English and
      Spanish speakers that could lead to improvements in artificial
      intelligence (AI) spoken dialogue systems.

  - title: A new way to “paint with light” to create radiant, color-changing items
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/mit-morphochrome-paints-objects-with-light-0120
    summary: Gemstones like precious opal are beautiful to look at and deceivingly
      complex. As you look at such gems from different angles, you’ll see a
      variety of tints glisten, causing you to question what color the rock
      actually is. It’s iridescent thanks to something called structural color —
      microscopic structures that reflect light to produce radiant
      hues.Structural color can be found across different organisms in nature,
      such as on the tails of peacocks and the wings of certain butterflies.
      Scientists and artists have been working to replicate this quality, but
      outside of the lab, it’s still very hard to recreate, causing a barrier to
      on-demand, customizable fabrication. Instead, companies and individual
      designers alike have resorted to adding existing color-changing objects
      like feathers and gems to things like personal items, clothes, and
      artwork.Now MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
      (CSAIL) researchers have replicated nature’s brilliance with a new optical
      system called “MorphoChrome.” MorphoChrome allows users to design and
      program iridescence onto everyday objects (like a glove, for example),
      augmenting them with the structurally colored multi-color glimmer
      reminiscent of many gemstones. You select particular colors from a color
      wheel in the team’s software program and use their handheld device to
      “paint” with multi-color light onto holographic film. Then, you apply that
      painted sheet to 3D-printed objects or flexible substrates such as fashion
      items, sporting goods, and other personal accessories, using their unique
      epoxy resin transfer process.“We wanted to tap into the innate
      intelligence of nature,” says MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and
      Computer Science (EECS) PhD student and CSAIL researcher Paris Myers SM
      ’25, who is a lead author on a recent paper presenting MorphoChrome. “In
      the past, you couldn’t easily synthesize structural color yourself, but
      using pigments or dyes gave you full creative expression. With our system,
      you have full creative agency over this new material space, predictably
      programming iridescent designs in real-time.”

  - title: A geometric twist boosts the power of robotic textiles
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-geometric-boosts-power-robotic-textiles.html
    summary: By rethinking how thin metal threads are woven into a flexible textile,
      EPFL researchers have created a lightweight fabric capable of lifting over
      400 times its own weight. The work advances the development of wearables
      that provide physical assistance without mechanical bulk.

  - title: Unbreakable? Researchers warn quantum computers have serious security flaws
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000330.htm
    summary: Quantum computers could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to
      business analytics—but their incredible power also makes them surprisingly
      vulnerable. New research from Penn State warns that today’s quantum
      machines are not just futuristic tools, but potential gold mines for
      hackers. The study reveals that weaknesses can exist not only in software,
      but deep within the physical hardware itself, where valuable algorithms
      and sensitive data may be exposed.

  - title: This tiny power module could change how the world uses energy
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233604.htm
    summary: As global energy demand surges—driven by AI-hungry data centers,
      advanced manufacturing, and electrified transportation—researchers at the
      National Renewable Energy Laboratory have unveiled a breakthrough that
      could help squeeze far more power from existing electricity supplies.
      Their new silicon-carbide-based power module, called ULIS, packs
      dramatically more power into a smaller, lighter, and cheaper design while
      wasting far less energy in the process.

    summary: Researchers have turned artificial intelligence into a powerful new
      lens for understanding why cancer survival rates differ so dramatically
      around the world. By analyzing cancer data and health system information
      from 185 countries, the AI model highlights which factors, such as access
      to radiotherapy, universal health coverage, and economic strength, are
      most closely linked to better survival in each nation.

    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
