  - title: New memristor training method slashes AI energy use by six orders of
      magnitude
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-memristor-method-slashes-ai-energy.html
    summary: In a Nature Communications study, researchers from China have developed
      an error-aware probabilistic update (EaPU) method that aligns memristor
      hardware's noisy updates with neural network training, slashing energy use
      by nearly six orders of magnitude versus GPUs while boosting accuracy on
      vision tasks. The study validates EaPU on 180 nm memristor arrays and
      large-scale simulations.

  - title: Engineers just created a “phonon laser” that could shrink your next
      smartphone
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035319.htm
    summary: Engineers have created a device that generates incredibly tiny,
      earthquake-like vibrations on a microchip—and it could transform future
      electronics. Using a new kind of “phonon laser,” the team can produce
      ultra-fast surface waves that already play a hidden role in smartphones,
      GPS systems, and wireless tech. Unlike today’s bulky setups, this
      single-chip device could deliver far higher performance using less power,
      opening the door to smaller, faster, and more efficient phones and
      wireless devices.

  - title: Soft robotic hand 'sees' around corners to achieve human-like touch
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-soft-robotic-corners-human.html
    summary: To reliably complete household chores, assemble products and tackle
      other manual tasks, robots should be able to adapt their manipulation
      strategies based on the objects they are working with, similarly to how
      humans leverage information they gain via the sense of touch. While humans
      attain tactile information via nerves in their skin and muscles, robots
      rely on sensors, devices that sense their surroundings and pick up
      specific physical signals.

  - title: AI maps the hidden forces shaping cancer survival worldwide
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260117053526.htm
    summary: Researchers have turned artificial intelligence into a powerful new
      lens for understanding why cancer survival rates differ so dramatically
      around the world. By analyzing cancer data and health system information
      from 185 countries, the AI model highlights which factors, such as access
      to radiotherapy, universal health coverage, and economic strength, are
      most closely linked to better survival in each nation.

  - title: Are There Enough Engineers for the AI Boom?
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers-engineers-jobs
    summary: The AI data center construction boom continues unabated, with the
      demand for power in the United States potentially reaching 106 gigawatts
      by 2035, according to a December report from research and analysis company
      BloombergNEF. That’s a 36 percent jump from the company’s previous
      outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe
      constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and—perhaps most
      significantly—a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that
      could turn the data center boom into a bust.

  - title: The breakthrough that makes robot faces feel less creepy
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035308.htm
    summary: Humans pay enormous attention to lips during conversation, and robots
      have struggled badly to keep up. A new robot developed at Columbia
      Engineering learned realistic lip movements by watching its own reflection
      and studying human videos online. This allowed it to speak and sing with
      synchronized facial motion, without being explicitly programmed.
      Researchers believe this breakthrough could help robots finally cross the
      uncanny valley.

  - title: How everyday foam reveals the secret logic of artificial intelligence
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260114084109.htm
    summary: Foams were once thought to behave like glass, with bubbles frozen in
      place at the microscopic level. But new simulations reveal that foam
      bubbles are always shifting, even while the foam keeps its overall shape.
      Remarkably, this restless motion follows the same math used to train
      artificial intelligence. The finding hints that learning-like behavior may
      be a fundamental principle shared by materials, machines, and living
      cells.

    summary: The MIT Siegel Family Quest for Intelligence (SQI), a research unit in
      the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, brings together researchers from
      across MIT who combine their diverse expertise to understand intelligence
      through tightly coupled scientific inquiry and rigorous engineering. These
      researchers engage in collaborative efforts spanning science, engineering,
      the humanities, and more.

    summary: 'If you use consumer AI systems, you have likely experienced something

      seems to lose track of the different ideas you have been talking about and
      how they fit together.'

    summary: Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin
      architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the
      Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach
      customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in
      inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to
      train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.

    summary: MIT’s senior capstone course 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes), an
      iconic class known colloquially on campus as “two double-oh nine,”
      emulates what engineers experience while working as part of a design team
      at a product development firm. The annual prototype launch is a colorful
      and exciting culmination of a semester’s worth of work.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
