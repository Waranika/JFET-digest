  - title: "Seamless tech: 'OriStitch' threads computation and 3D textiles"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-seamless-tech-oristitch-threads-3d.html
    summary: Could a flat piece of fabric hold a 3D shape, the way paper does in
      origami? Aiming to find out, researchers from the Cornell Ann S. Bowers
      College of Computing and Information Science developed OriStitch, a new
      software and fabrication system that takes simple 3D objects—a toy or a
      teapot, say—and spins them into a design for a textile version using
      carefully placed stitches in fabric.

    summary: In the horticultural world, some vines are especially grabby. As they
      grow, the woody tendrils can wrap around obstacles with enough force to
      pull down entire fences and trees.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-fully-digital-paves-scalable-probabilistic.html
    summary: Artificial intelligence and machine learning could become dramatically
      more efficient, thanks to a new type of computer component developed by
      researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Tohoku
      University, in collaboration with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
      Company (TSMC).

  - title: Scientists reveal a tiny brain chip that streams thoughts in real time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209234139.htm
    summary: BISC is an ultra-thin neural implant that creates a high-bandwidth
      wireless link between the brain and computers. Its tiny single-chip design
      packs tens of thousands of electrodes and supports advanced AI models for
      decoding movement, perception, and intent. Initial clinical work shows it
      can be inserted through a small opening in the skull and remain stable
      while capturing detailed neural activity. The technology could reshape
      treatments for epilepsy, paralysis, and blindness.

  - title: AI predicts complex social group behavior using individual attributes
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-complex-social-group-behavior.html
    summary: Professor Kijung Shin's research team at the Kim Jaechul Graduate
      School of AI has developed an AI technology that predicts complex social
      group behavior by analyzing how individual attributes such as age and role
      influence group relationships.

  - title: A Quantum Components Industry Is Emerging
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-components-industry
    summary: The punishingly cold temperatures and fragile quantum states at the
      heart of a quantum computer put extreme constraints on the electronics
      that support them. So far, quantum computing companies have had to solve
      these challenges in-house, but as the field matures, a burgeoning quantum
      components industry is springing up to provide off-the-shelf solutions.

  - title: Engineered imperfections supercharge graphene’s power
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004738.htm
    summary: Researchers have discovered a new way to grow graphene that
      deliberately adds structural defects to enhance its usefulness in
      electronics, sensors, catalysts, and more. Using a specially shaped
      molecule called azupyrene, scientists can produce graphene films rich in
      beneficial 5–7 ring defects—imperfections that make the material more
      interactive, more magnetic, and more electronically versatile.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
