  - title: Why I'm building an office out of straw
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-im-office-straw.html
    summary: When we moved into our house, there was a shed in the garden. Its
      timbers were rotten, the floor had long since disappeared into the ground,
      there was no door, the window had fallen out and various creatures had
      moved in.

  - title: AI algorithm enables tracking of vital white matter pathways
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/new-window-on-brainstem-ai-algorithm-enables-tracking-white-matter-pathways-0210
    summary: The signals that drive many of the brain and body’s most essential
      functions — consciousness, sleep, breathing, heart rate, and motion —
      course through bundles of “white matter” fibers in the brainstem, but
      imaging systems so far have been unable to finely resolve these crucial
      neural cables. That has left researchers and doctors with little
      capability to assess how they are affected by trauma or neurodegeneration.

  - title: Magnetic mixer improves 3D bioprinting
    url: https://news.mit.edu/2026/magnetic-mixer-improves-3d-bioprinting-0210
    summary: 3D bioprinting, in which living tissues are printed with cells mixed
      into soft hydrogels, or “bio-inks,” is widely used in the field of
      bioengineering for modeling or replacing the tissues in our bodies. The
      print quality and reproducibility of tissues, however, can face
      challenges. One of the most significant challenges is created simply by
      gravity — cells naturally sink to the bottom of the bioink-extruding
      printer syringe because the cells are heavier than the hydrogel around
      them.

  - title: "Reasoning: A smarter way for AI to understand text and images"
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-smarter-ai-text-images.html
    summary: Engineers at the University of California San Diego have developed a
      new way to train artificial intelligence systems to solve complex problems
      more reliably, particularly those that require interpreting both text and
      images. In widely used tests to evaluate mathematical reasoning, AI models
      trained with this method outperformed others in solving math word problems
      containing visual elements like charts and diagrams.

      rotations in the air.

  - title: Startups Are Betting on Orbital Growth for Advanced Electronics
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-orbit-manufacturing
    summary: This past December, the U.K. start-up Space Forge turned on an orbital
      furnace aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite, producing a stream of super-hot
      plasma that could someday enable production of near-ideal semiconductor
      crystals in orbit. Hailed as a breakthrough in orbital manufacturing, the
      milestone is a first for a free-flying commercial satellite and a payload
      not operated by humans.

  - title: How and When the Memory Chip Shortage Will End
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/dram-shortage
    summary: If it feels these days as if everything in technology is about AI,
      that’s because it is. And nowhere is that more true than in the market for
      computer memory. Demand, and profitability, for the type of DRAM used to
      feed GPUs and other accelerators in AI data centers is so huge that it’s
      diverting away supply of memory for other uses and causing prices to
      skyrocket. According to Counterpoint Research, DRAM prices have risen
      80-90 precent so far this quarter.

  - title: AI reads brain MRIs in seconds and flags emergencies
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210005419.htm
    summary: Researchers at the University of Michigan have created an AI system
      that can interpret brain MRI scans in just seconds, accurately identifying
      a wide range of neurological conditions and determining which cases need
      urgent care. Trained on hundreds of thousands of real-world scans along
      with patient histories, the model achieved accuracy as high as 97.5% and
      outperformed other advanced AI tools.

  - title: Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260209221713.htm
    summary: Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it
      behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how
      long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any
      external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb
      light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions
      are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the
      atomic structure of the material involved.

      bends
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-rotating-nozzle-3d-air-powered.html
    summary: Soft robots made out of flexible, biocompatible materials are in high
      demand in industries from health care to manufacturing, but precisely
      designing and controlling such robots for specific purposes is a perennial
      challenge. What if you could 3D print a soft robot with predictable
      shape-morphing capabilities already built in? Harvard 3D printing experts
      have shown it's possible.

    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-02-small-modular-reactors-gain-competitive.html
    summary: Advanced nuclear is within reach—and a new digital twin reveals how
      smarter plant operations can enhance the economic viability and safety of
      small modular reactors, or SMRs. In collaboration with the University of
      Tennessee and GE Vernova Hitachi, researchers at Oak Ridge National
      Laboratory recently published research in the journal Nuclear Science and
      Engineering on a new risk-informed digital twin designed to enhance
      operational decision-making for the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR
      design.

  - title: A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm
    summary: Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to
      disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to
      perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than
      pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice
      surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing
      control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up
      into something truly powerful.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/explore-stratosphere-diy-pico-balloon
    summary: "There’s an interesting development in amateur ballooning: using
      so-called superpressure balloons, which float high in the atmosphere
      indefinitely rather than simply going up and up and then popping like a
      normal weather balloon. Superpressure balloons can last for months and
      travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the
      while reporting their position."
