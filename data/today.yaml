  - title: New study unveils ultra-high sensitivity broadband flexible photodetectors
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-unveils-ultra-high-sensitivity-broadband.html
    summary: A research team, affiliated with UNIST, has unveiled a flexible
      photodetector, capable of converting light across a broad spectrum—from
      visible to near-infrared—into electrical signals. This innovation promises
      significant advancements in technologies that require simultaneous
      detection of object colors and internal structures or materials.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/poetry-for-engineers-ode
    summary: "As fairies for the Irish or leeks for Welsh,it’s the secret lives of
      small hidden machines,their junctures, and networks that inspire me:Mystic
      hidden functionaries that makeour made world live, brave little servo
      motors,whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filledsensors are encased in
      bakelite with brassscrews, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,who
      notice tiny motions and respond,whose cooling fans call out in
      white-noiseregisters like older folk singers–I canalmost hear their
      earlier songs, their strong voicesnow yelps, their thumps, their throbs,
      their hum, their chant–,they click, they whir, they are sent
      spinninginside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.Most of all: ones
      waiting silently, concealingthe surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet
      known,their true natures found only in connections."

  - title: Say what's on your mind, and AI can tell what kind of person you are
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-mind-ai-kind-person.html
    summary: If you say a few words, generative AI will understand who you are—maybe
      even better than your close family and friends. A new University of
      Michigan study found that widely available generative AI models (e.g.,
      ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMa) can predict personality, key behaviors and daily
      emotions as or even more accurately than those closest to you. The
      findings appear in the journal Nature Human Behavior.

  - title: A breakthrough that could make ships nearly unsinkable
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260130041105.htm
    summary: Researchers have found a way to make ordinary aluminum tubes float
      indefinitely, even when submerged for long periods or punched full of
      holes. By engineering the metal’s surface to repel water, the tubes trap
      air inside and refuse to sink, even in rough conditions. The technology
      could eventually be scaled up into floating platforms, ships, or even
      wave-powered energy systems.

    url: https://www.wired.com/story/microdosing-for-depression-appears-to-work-about-as-well-as-drinking-coffee/
    summary: For years, people from CEOs to novelists have taken tiny amounts of
      psychedelics to support well-being. New research shows that benefits for
      depression may be attributable to a placebo effect.

  - title: When Will AI Agents Be Ready for Autonomous Business Operations?
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-benchmarks
    summary: AI agents abound—and they’re increasingly gaining autonomy. From
      navigating the web to recursively improving its own coding skills, agentic
      AI promises to reorder the online economy and redefine the internet.

  - title: Scientists found a way to cool quantum computers using noise
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260129080418.htm
    summary: Quantum computers need extreme cold to work, but the very systems that
      keep them cold also create noise that can destroy fragile quantum
      information. Scientists in Sweden have now flipped that problem on its
      head by building a tiny quantum refrigerator that actually uses noise to
      drive cooling instead of fighting it. By carefully steering heat at
      unimaginably small scales, the device can act as a refrigerator, heat
      engine, or energy amplifier inside quantum circuits.

  - title: Great Refactor Initiative Looks to AI to Harden Critical Code
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-rust-great-refactor
    summary: "Many of the world’s critical IT systems remain riddled with bugs, and
      AI tools threaten to make it easier than ever to exploit them. But AI
      could also be part of the solution: A new initiative aims to automatically
      convert vulnerable code into the security-focused language Rust, which
      would eliminate the vast majority of known software vulnerabilities."

  - title: Emoticons can confuse LLMs, causing 'silent failures' in coding responses
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-emoticons-llms-silent-failures-coding.html
    summary: Large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
      can process and generate texts in various languages, are now widely used
      by people worldwide. These models have proved to be effective in rapidly
      sourcing information, answering questions, creating written content for
      specific applications and writing computer code.

    summary: The Pappalardo Apprentice program pushes the boundaries of the
      traditional lab experience, inviting a selected group of juniors and
      seniors to advance their fabrication skills while also providing mentor
      training and peer-to-peer mentoring opportunities in an environment fueled
      by creativity, safety, and fun.

      thinks it might change your mind
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ready-robots-homes-maker-friendly.html
    summary: As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding
      its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like "eyebrows" and
      offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the
      sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
