    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai
    summary: If you’ve shopped on Amazon in the past few months, you might have
      noticed it has gotten easier to find what you’re looking for. Listings now
      have more images, detailed product names, and better descriptions. The
      website’s predictive search feature uses the listing updates to anticipate
      needs and suggests a list of items in real time as you type in the search
      bar.

  - title: Team develops chips that act like brains and makes them scalable
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-team-chips-brains-scalable.html
    summary: Developing chips that simulate how the brain works has great promise
      for AI, robotics, and other fields. But making them so that they're
      scalable while providing repeatable results has proven tricky. Now, a
      Yale-led team of researchers has put forth a solution. The results are
      published in Nature Communications.

  - title: Speech-to-reality system creates objects on demand using AI and robotics
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-speech-reality-demand-ai-robotics.html
    summary: Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we
      can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact,
      MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven
      workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and "speak
      objects into existence," creating things like furniture in as little as
      five minutes.

  - title: A Quantum Components Industry Is Emerging
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-components-industry
    summary: The punishingly cold temperatures and fragile quantum states at the
      heart of a quantum computer put extreme constraints on the electronics
      that support them. So far, quantum computing companies have had to solve
      these challenges in-house, but as the field matures, a burgeoning quantum
      components industry is springing up to provide off-the-shelf solutions.

  - title: This tiny implant sends secret messages to the brain
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052515.htm
    summary: Researchers have built a fully implantable device that sends
      light-based messages directly to the brain. Mice learned to interpret
      these artificial patterns as meaningful signals, even without touch,
      sight, or sound. The system uses up to 64 micro-LEDs to create complex
      neural patterns that resemble natural sensory activity. It could pave the
      way for next-generation prosthetics and new therapies.

    summary: A spray-on coating to keep power lines standing through an ice storm
      may not be the obvious fix for winter outages — but it’s exactly the kind
      of innovation that happens when MIT students tackle a sustainability
      challenge.

  - title: Engineered imperfections supercharge graphene’s power
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004738.htm
    summary: Researchers have discovered a new way to grow graphene that
      deliberately adds structural defects to enhance its usefulness in
      electronics, sensors, catalysts, and more. Using a specially shaped
      molecule called azupyrene, scientists can produce graphene films rich in
      beneficial 5–7 ring defects—imperfections that make the material more
      interactive, more magnetic, and more electronically versatile.

    summary: Researchers unveiled a new technique that validates quantum computer
      results—especially those from GBS devices—in minutes instead of millennia.
      Their findings expose unexpected errors in a landmark experiment, offering
      a crucial step toward truly reliable quantum machines.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
