      Lewis ScD ’91 at the 2025 Mildred S. Dresselhaus Lecture, organized by
      MIT.nano, on Nov. 3. “The grand challenge goal is to create these tissues
      for therapeutic use and, ultimately, at the whole organ scale.”

  - title: AI headphones automatically learn who you're talking to—and let you hear
      them better
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-ai-headphones-automatically-youre.html
    summary: Holding a conversation in a crowded room often leads to the frustrating
      "cocktail party problem," or the challenge of separating the voices of
      conversation partners from a hubbub. It's a mentally taxing situation that
      can be exacerbated by hearing impairment.

  - title: Composite rivets offer lighter, corrosion-free joints for bridges, docks
      and more
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-composite-rivets-lighter-corrosion-free.html
    summary: Researchers from Skoltech and Harbin Institute of Technology have
      devised and tested a new mechanism for joining together the composite
      parts that make up bridges, the cooling towers of power stations, water
      treatment facilities, marine terminals, and offshore oil rigs. The
      solution provides an alternative to the heavy and corrosion-prone metal
      bolts.

  - title: Amazon’s “Catalog AI” Product Platform Helps You Shop Smarter
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai
    summary: If you’ve shopped on Amazon in the past few months, you might have
      noticed it has gotten easier to find what you’re looking for. Listings now
      have more images, detailed product names, and better descriptions. The
      website’s predictive search feature uses the listing updates to anticipate
      needs and suggests a list of items in real time as you type in the search
      bar.

  - title: A Quantum Components Industry Is Emerging
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-components-industry
    summary: The punishingly cold temperatures and fragile quantum states at the
      heart of a quantum computer put extreme constraints on the electronics
      that support them. So far, quantum computing companies have had to solve
      these challenges in-house, but as the field matures, a burgeoning quantum
      components industry is springing up to provide off-the-shelf solutions.

  - title: This tiny implant sends secret messages to the brain
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052515.htm
    summary: Researchers have built a fully implantable device that sends
      light-based messages directly to the brain. Mice learned to interpret
      these artificial patterns as meaningful signals, even without touch,
      sight, or sound. The system uses up to 64 micro-LEDs to create complex
      neural patterns that resemble natural sensory activity. It could pave the
      way for next-generation prosthetics and new therapies.

  - title: Engineered imperfections supercharge graphene’s power
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004738.htm
    summary: Researchers have discovered a new way to grow graphene that
      deliberately adds structural defects to enhance its usefulness in
      electronics, sensors, catalysts, and more. Using a specially shaped
      molecule called azupyrene, scientists can produce graphene films rich in
      beneficial 5–7 ring defects—imperfections that make the material more
      interactive, more magnetic, and more electronically versatile.

    summary: Researchers unveiled a new technique that validates quantum computer
      results—especially those from GBS devices—in minutes instead of millennia.
      Their findings expose unexpected errors in a landmark experiment, offering
      a crucial step toward truly reliable quantum machines.

  - title: Listen to Protons for Less Than $100
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/listen-to-protons-diy-magnetometer
    summary: "When you get an MRI scan, the machine exploits a phenomenon called
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain kinds of atomic nuclei—including
      those of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule—can be made to oscillate
      in a magnetic field, and these oscillations can be detected with coils of
      wire. MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances
      at tens to hundreds of megahertz. However, another NMR-based instrument
      involves much lower-frequency oscillations: a proton-precession
      magnetometer, often used to measure Earth’s magnetic field."
