  - title: Grasshopper wings inspire gliding robot design
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-grasshopper-wings-gliding-robot.html
    summary: A collaboration between Princeton University engineers and
      entomologists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign began with
      the researchers chasing grasshoppers in a hot parking lot. Their eventual
      focus on the hindwings of one species of grasshopper, Schistocerca
      americana, the American grasshopper, is inspiring a new approach to
      untethered gliding flight.

  - title: Ten steps to designing more empathetic, human and effective educational
      video games
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ten-empathetic-human-effective-video.html
    summary: Video games have come to be regarded as valuable educational resources.
      Through a combination of interactive environments and learning objectives,
      they have proven to be an effective tool in multiple fields, from school
      education to corporate training. However, their full adoption in formal
      education remains limited by a lack of curricular integration and clear
      strategies to incorporate them into educational programs, a lack of
      specific teacher training and a shortage of technological and technical
      resources.

    summary: The James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Center on Inequality and Shaping the
      Future of Work officially launched on Nov. 3, 2025, bringing together
      scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to explore critical questions
      about economic opportunity, technology, and democracy.

  - title: With some help from AI, your next move can be predicted
    url: https://techxplore.com/news/2026-01-ai.html
    summary: AI might know where you're going before you do. Researchers at
      Northeastern University used large language models, the kind of advanced
      artificial intelligence normally designed to process and generate
      language, to predict human movement.

  - title: Scientists create robots smaller than a grain of salt that can think
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260105165815.htm
    summary: Researchers have created microscopic robots so small they’re barely
      visible, yet smart enough to sense, decide, and move completely on their
      own. Powered by light and equipped with tiny computers, the robots swim by
      manipulating electric fields rather than using moving parts. They can
      detect temperature changes, follow programmed paths, and even work
      together in groups. The breakthrough marks the first truly autonomous
      robots at this microscopic scale.

  - title: Tiny 3D-printed light cages could unlock the quantum internet
    url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106001907.htm
    summary: A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap
      light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum
      information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and
      filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate
      side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The
      result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum
      communication and computing.

    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-growth
    summary: If a data center is moving in next door, you probably live in the
      United States. More than half of all upcoming global data centers—as
      indicated by land purchased for data centers not yet announced, those
      under construction, and those whose plans are public—will be developed in
      the United States.

  - title: See the Sky Like Never Before With a DIY Eyepiece
    url: https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece
    summary: When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects,
      amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options. They can view with
      the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects
      as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they
      can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results
      on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing
      experience.

    summary: Students can take many possible routes through MIT’s curriculum, which
      can zigag through different departments, linking classes and disciplines
      in unexpected ways. With so many options, charting an academic path can be
      overwhelming, but a new tool called NerdXing is here to help.
